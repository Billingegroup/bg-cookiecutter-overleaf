  abstract = {Nanoporous carbons (NPCs) are useful in adsorptive separations and catalysis, owing to their ability to discriminate between molecules on the basis of size and shape. This property arises from their narrow pore size distribution, which is typically centred at a size corresponding to 0.5 nm. Despite this level of nanoregularity. there is no long-range order within these materials. Structural coherence dissipates to extinction at distances longer than 1--1.2 nm. For this reason, these nanoporous materials are complex solids and offer an intriguing problem in structural simulation and modelling. We show that modelling the spatial complexity of NPCs can be overcome by their chemical simplicity. Recognizing that the structures are comprised of trigonal sp2 carbon and imposing chemical and physical constraints on the possible outcomes of the simulation provide a means to surmounting the modelling problem presented by the intrinsic disorder. By this approach, models of the solid can be arrived at that match the density, hydrogen to carbon ratio and neutron diffraction patterns of actual NPCs quite well. Thus, by using chemical logic and experimentally grounded constraints, good three-dimensional structures for NPC can be obtained by simulation.},

  abstract = {Compound phases often display properties that are symmetry forbidden relative to their nominal, average crystallographic symmetry, even if extrinsic reasons (defects, strain, or imperfections) are not apparent. Specifically, breaking the macroscopic inversion symmetry of a centrosymmetric phase can dominate or significantly change its observed properties while the detailed mechanisms and magnitudes of the deviations of symmetry breaking are often obscure. Here, we choose piezoelectricity as a tool to investigate macroscopic inversion-symmetry breaking in nominally centrosymmetric materials as a prominent example and measure resonant piezoelectric spectroscopy (RPS) and Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) in 15 compounds, 18 samples, and 21 different phases, including unpoled ferroelectrics, paraelectrics, relaxors, ferroelastics, incipient ferroelectrics, and isotropic materials with low defect concentrations, i.e., NaCl, fused silica, and CaF2. We exclude the flexoelectric effect as a source of the observed piezoelectricity yet observe piezoelectricity in all nominally cubic phases of these samples. By scaling the RPS intensities with those of RUS, we calibrate the effective piezoelectric coefficients using single-crystal quartz as standard. Using this scaling we determine the effective piezoelectric modulus in nominally nonpiezoelectric phases, finding that the ``symmetry-forbidden'' piezoelectric effect ranges from {$\sim$}1 to 10-5 pm/V ({$\sim$}0.5\% to {$\sim$}2{\texttimes}10-5\% of the piezoelectric coefficient of poled ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate). The values for the unpoled ferroelectric phase are only slightly higher than those in the paraelectric phase. The extremely low coefficients are well below the detection limit of conventional piezoelectric measurements and demonstrate RPS as a convenient and ultrahighly sensitive method to measure piezoelectricity. We suggest that symmetry-breaking piezoelectricity in nominally centrosymmetric materials and disordered, unpoled ferroelectrics is a common phenomenon.},

  abstract = {The evolution of the magnetic state, crystal structure and microstructure parameters of nanocrystalline zinc--ferrite, tuned by thermal annealing of {$\sim$}4 nm nanoparticles, was systematically studied by complementary characterization methods. Structural analysis of neutron and synchrotron x-ray radiation data revealed a mixed cation distribution in the nanoparticle samples, with the degree of inversion systematically decreasing from 0.25 in an as-prepared nanocrystalline sample to a non-inverted spinel structure with a normal cation distribution in the bulk counterpart. The results of DC magnetization and M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy experiments indicated a superparamagnetic relaxation in {$\sim$}4 nm nanoparticles, albeit with different freezing temperatures T f of 27.5 K and 46 K, respectively. The quadrupole splitting parameter decreases with the annealing temperature due to cation redistribution between the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the spinel structure and the associated defects. DC magnetization measurements indicated the existence of significant interparticle interactions among nanoparticles (`superspins'). Additional confirmation for the presence of interparticle interactions was found from the fit of the T f (H) dependence to the AT line, from which a value of the anisotropy constant of K eff = 5.6 {\texttimes} 10 5 erg cm -3 was deduced. Further evidence for strong interparticle interactions was found from AC susceptibility measurements, where the frequency dependence of the freezing temperature T f ( f ) was satisfactory described by both Vogel--Fulcher and dynamic scaling theory, both applicable for interacting systems. The parameters obtained from these fits suggest collective freezing of magnetic moments at T f .},

Here, we use time-resolved x-ray diffraction to examine the ultrafast melting of polycrystalline gold thin films using an optical laser pump followed by a delayed hard x-ray probe pulse. We observe the formation of an intermediate new diffraction peak, which we attribute to material trapped between the solid and melted states, that forms 50 ps after laser excitation and persists beyond 500 ps. The peak width grows rapidly for 50 ps and then narrows distinctly at longer time scales. We attribute this to a melting band originating from the grain boundaries and propagating into the grains. Our observation of this intermediate state has implications for the use of ultrafast lasers for ablation during pulsed laser deposition. Laser melting of polycrystalline metals starts at the internal grain boundaries and propagates into the grains.

  abstract = {Homogeneous reaction precursors may be used to form several solid-state compounds inaccessible by traditional synthetic routes, but there has been little development of techniques that allow for a priori prediction of what may crystallize in a given material system. Here, the local structures of FeSbx designed precursors are determined and compared with the structural motifs of their crystalline products. X-ray total scattering and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis are used to show that precursors that first nucleate a metastable FeSb3 compound share similar local structure to the product. Interestingly, precursors that directly crystallize to thermodynamically stable FeSb2 products also contain local structural motifs of the metastable phase, despite their compositional disagreement. While both crystalline phases consist of distorted FeSb6 octahedra with Sb shared between either two or three octahedra as required for stoichiometry, a corner-sharing arrangement indicative of AX3-type structures is the only motif apparent in the PDF of either precursor. Prior speculation was that local composition controlled which compounds nucleate from amorphous intermediates, with different compositions favoring different local arrangements and hence different products. This data suggests that local environments in these amorphous intermediates may not be very sensitive to overall composition. This can provide insight into potential metastable phases which may form in a material system, even with a precursor that does not crystallize to the kinetically stabilized product. Determination of local structure in homogeneous amorphous reaction intermediates from techniques such as PDF can be a valuable asset in the development of systematic methods to prepare targeted solid-state compounds from designed precursors.},

  abstract = {Lead halide perovskites such as methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) have outstanding optical and electronic properties for photovoltaic applications, yet a full understanding of how this solution-processable material works so well is currently missing. Previous research has revealed that CH3NH3PbI3 possesses multiple forms of static disorder regardless of preparation method, which is surprising in light of its excellent performance. Using high energy resolution inelastic X-ray (HERIX) scattering, we measure phonon dispersions in CH3NH3PbI3 and find direct evidence for another form of disorder in single crystals: large-amplitude anharmonic zone edge rotational instabilities of the PbI6 octahedra that persist to room temperature and above, left over from structural phase transitions that take place tens to hundreds of degrees below. Phonon calculations show that the orientations of the methylammonium (CH3NH3+) couple strongly and cooperatively to these modes. The result is a noncentrosymmetric, instantaneous local structure, which we observe in atomic pair distribution function (PDF) measurements. This local symmetry breaking is unobservable by Bragg diffraction but can explain key material properties such as the structural phase sequence, ultralow thermal transport, and large minority charge carrier lifetimes despite moderate carrier mobility. From the PDF we estimate the size of the fluctuating symmetry broken domains to be between 1 and 3 nm in diameter.},

The influence of precursor substitution, ligand sterics, and reaction temperature on the final nanocrystal size was evaluated. Using saturated hydrocarbon solvents and saturated aliphatic carboxylate ligands, polymeric byproducts could be avoided and pure ZnS nanocrystals isolated. Elevated temperatures, slower precursor conversion reactivity, and branched zinc 2-hexyldecanoate yield the largest ZnS nanocrystals. Carefully purified zinc carboxylate, rapidly converting precursors, and cooling the synthesis mixture following complete precursor conversion provide quasispherical nanocrystals with the narrowest shape dispersity. Nanocrystal sizes were measured using pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of X-ray scattering and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and plotted versus the energy of their first excitonic optical absorption. The resulting empirical relationship provides a useful method to characterize the nanocrystal size from 1.7 to 4.0 nm using optical absorption spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {JUAMI, the joint undertaking for an African materials institute, is a project to build collaborations and materials research capabilities between PhD researchers in Africa, the United States, and the world. Focusing on research-active universities in the East African countries of Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda, the effort has run a series of schools focused on materials for sustainable energy and materials for sustainable development. These bring together early-career researchers from Africa, the US, and beyond, for two weeks in a close-knit environment. The program includes lectures on cutting-edge research from internationally renowned speakers, highly interactive tutorial lectures on the science behind the research, also from internationally known researchers, and hands-on practicals and team-building exercises that culminate in group proposals from self-formed student teams. The schools have benefited more than 300 early-career students and led to proposals that have received funding and have led to research collaborations and educational non-profits. JUAMI continues and has an ongoing community of alumni who share resources and expertise, and is open to like-minded people who want to join and develop contacts and collaborations internationally.},

However, in this paper, we, somewhat whimsically, explore some ideas about what a material's gene could be and how it could be used to further our understanding of materials structure and properties. The result is a slightly non-conventional, less crystal-centric, view of materials structure that we believe can, will, and is resulting in novel materials insights.},

(2) Is the ground-state of the ferromagnetic metallic phase delocalized or polaronic. (3) As one moves away from the ground-state, by raising temperature or decreasing doping, towards the metal insulator transition, how does the state of the material evolve?},

These deviations take the form of displacements of oxygen atoms parallel to the z axis by 0.09{\textpm}0.02 {\AA} at 10 K and 0.12{\textpm}0.04 {\AA} at room temperature. The effect occurs on every oxygen site and may be correlated in sign from site to site, giving rise to short-range order. The average crystal structure, refined using Rietveld analysis, does not show this distortion, which must, therefore, extend only over short range. A lattice-energy-minimization calculation on the idealized compound CaCuO2, using pair potentials, indicates that such a distortion lowers the calculated lattice energy. A mechanism is proposed by which the strontium atoms break up the periodicity of the displacements and stabilize the structure.},

In the paramagnetic insulating phase we find evidence for three distinct bond lengths which we ascribe to Mn4+-O, Mn3+-O-short, and Mn3+-O-long bonds, respectively. In the ferromagnetic metallic (FM) phase, for x=0.33 and T=20K, we find a single Mn-O bond length; however, as the metal-insulator transition is approached either by increasing T or decreasing x, intensity progressively appears around r=2.15 and in the region 1.85-1.9{\AA} suggesting the appearance of Mn3+-O-long bonds and short Mn4+-O bonds. This is strong evidence that charge localized and delocalized phases coexist close to the metal-insulator transition in the FM phase.},

In the present work, we investigate the mercury-binding mechanism for representative thiol-functionalized mesostructures by atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data and by Raman spectroscopy. The mesostructures with wormhole framework structures and compositions corresponding to x = 0.30 and 0.50 were prepared by direct assembly methods in the presence of a structure-directing amine porogen. PDF analyses of five mercury-loaded compositions with Hg/S ratios of 0.50-1.30 provided evidence for the bridging of thiolate sulfur atoms to two metal ion centers and the formation of chain structures on the pore surfaces. We find no evidence for Hg-O bonds and can rule out oxygen coordination of the mercury at greater than the 10\% level. The relative intensities of the PDF peaks corresponding to Hg-S and Hg-Hg atomic pairs indicate that the mercury centers cluster on the functionalized surfaces by virtue of thiolate bridging, regardless of the overall mercury loading. However, the Raman results indicate that the complexation of mercury centers by thiolate depends on the mercury loading. At low mercury loadings (Hg/S {$\leq$} 0.5), the dominant species is an electrically neutral complex in which mercury most likely is tetrahedrally coordinated to bridging thiolate ligands, as in Hg(SBut)2. At higher loadings (Hg/S 1.0-1.3), mercury complex cations predominate, as evidenced by the presence of charge-balancing anions (nitrate) on the surface. This cationic form of bound mercury is assigned a linear coordination to two bridging thiolate ligands.},

We describe a variational approach that could be applied to find data correction parameters that is highly automatable and should require little in the way of user inputs yet results in quantitatively reliable PDFs, modulo unknown scale factors that are often not of scientific interest when profile fitting models are applied to the data with scale factor as a parameter. We have worked on a particular implementation of these ideas and demonstrate that it yields PDFs that are of comparable quality to those obtained with the existing x-ray data reduction program PDFgetX2. This opens the door to rapid and highly automated processing of raw data to obtain PDFs.},

The technique used is the refinement of the atomic pair density function (PDF), which was obtained from neutron-powder-diffraction data. This is a nonstandard technique and thus it is described in some detail in this paper. We find that the CuO2 planes in these materials are not flat but are buckled and distorted by oxygen displacements of magnitude {$\lessequivlnt$}0.1 {\AA}. The displacements cannot be explained simply by the presence of different-sized impurity dopant ions in the lattice. The local structure is best explained if the CuO2 planes are spatially inhomogeneous. There are two types of local regions, or domains, one heavily distorted and the other relatively undistorted. The structure within the distorted regions is well ordered with a distinct symmetry that is lower than that of the parent structure. A model for this local order is presented. From the PDF we estimate the size of these domains to be {$\sim$}6 {\AA}. Ion-size arguments suggest that the CuO2 plane is in tension in this material and plane-buckling distortions are not expected from steric arguments. We present a mechanism whereby the buckling could be stabilized by a strong coupling to the electronic system via narrow-band Op states. This gives rise to lattice-induced hole states that coexist with the usual, impurity-doped, electrons. We speculate on the possible implications this has for the superconductivity of this material.},

  abstract = {In this study, we use state-of-the-art X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics to analyze amine-water mixtures that show the unusual lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior. The goal is to provide direct experimental evidence for the entropy-lowering molecular cluster formation hypothesized as necessary for LCST behavior. Differential wide-angle X-ray scattering and pair distribution analysis and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements were combined with molecular modeling and liquid-liquid equilibrium measurements, revealing direct experimental evidence for the hypothesis. However, the response of the amine phase to accommodating water is even more subtle than the simple hypothesis suggests, with the formation of robust nanoscale reverse micelles. The techniques developed in this paper can be expected to yield insights in the use of temperature-switchable liquids in solvent extraction and other separations, and the stabilization of organelles in living cells that do not have physical membranes but do require compositional gradients to operate.},

  abstract = {The importance of charge reservoir layers for supplying holes to the \$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{CuO\}\}\_\{2\}\$ planes of cuprate superconductors has long been recognized. Less attention has been paid to the screening of the charge transfer by the intervening ionic layers. We address this issue in the case of \$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{YBa\}\}\_\{2\}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Cu\}\}\_\{3\}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{6+x\}\$, where CuO chains supply the holes for the planes. We present a simple dielectric-screening model that gives a linear correlation between the relative displacements of ions along the \$c\$ axis, determined by neutron powder diffraction, and the hole density of the planes. Applying this model to the temperature-dependent shifts of ions along the \$c\$ axis, we infer a charge transfer of 5{\textbackslash}char21\{\}10\% of the hole density from the planes to the chains on warming from the superconducting transition to room temperature. Given the significant coupling of \$c\$-axis displacements to the average charge density, we point out the relevance of local displacements for screening charge modulations and note recent evidence for dynamic screening of in-plane quasiparticles. This line of argument leads us to a simple model for atomic displacements and charge modulation that is consistent with images from scanning-tunneling microscopy for underdoped \$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Bi\}\}\_\{2\}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Sr\}\}\_\{2\}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{CaCu\}\}\_\{2\}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{8+{\textbackslash}ensuremath\{{\textbackslash}delta\}\}\$.},

We argue that this observation would suggest the presence of local charge-stripe order. We show that the tilts are locally LTO in the undoped phase, in agreement with the average crystal structure. At nonzero doping the PDF data are consistent with the presence of local tilt disorder in the form of a mixture of LTO and LTT local tilt directions and a distribution of local tilt magnitudes. We present topological tilt models which qualitatively explain the origin of tilt disorder in the presence of charge stripes and show that the PDF data are well explained by such a mixture of locally small and large amplitude tilts.},

An atomic pair distribution function (PDF) approach reveals that there are no local dimers that survive into the metallic phase when this is invoked by temperature and doping. The PDF shows Ir4+ dimers when they exist, regardless of whether or not they are long-range ordered. At 100 K, exposure to a 98 keV x-ray beam melts the long-range dimer order within a few seconds, though the local dimers remain intact. This shows that the metallic state accessed on warming and doping is qualitatively different from the state obtained under x-ray irradiation.},

Using experimental and theoretical probes of the local structure, we demonstrate this behavior in binary lead chalcogenides, which were believed to adopt the ideal, undistorted rock-salt structure at all temperatures. The behavior is consistent with a simple thermodynamic model in which the emerging dipoles are stabilized in the disordered state at high temperature due to the extra configurational entropy despite the fact that the undistorted structure has lower internal energy. Our findings shed light on the anomalous electronic and thermoelectric properties of the lead chalcogenides. Similar searches may show that the phenomenon is more widespread. Upon heating, lead telluride and lead sulfide show the formation of a less symmetric, dipolar structure.

Substantial Sn displacements with a dipolar character persist in the high-symmetry high-temperature phase, albeit with a symmetry different from that of the ordered displacements below the transition. The analysis implies that the transition is neither order-disorder nor displacive but rather a complex crossover. Robust ferrocoupled SnSe intralayer distortions suggest a ferroelectriclike instability as the driving force. These local symmetry-lowering Sn displacements are likely integral to the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity mechanism in SnSe.},

  abstract = {The local and intermediate structure of La 1 - x Ca x MnO 3 has been studied in the orthorhombic (O) and pseudo-cubic ( O {$\prime$} ) phases, both as a function of temperature ( x = 0.00 ) , and as a function of Ca content (at 310 K). Neutron powder diffraction-based high real space resolution atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis shows that the Jahn Teller distortion of the MnO 6 octahedra persists locally deep in the O {$\prime$} phase in both cases studied, contrary to the average crystallographic view. The O to O {$\prime$} structural phase transformation does have a local structural signature evidenced as a dramatic change in a PDF peak at 10.3 {\AA} sensitive to the rotations of the MnO 6 octahedra, providing further evidence that the nature of the transformation is orbital order to disorder regardless of whether the phase boundary is crossed as a function of T or x.},

  abstract = {A long-standing puzzle regarding the disparity of local and long-range CuO6 octahedral tilt correlations in the underdoped regime of La2-xBaxCuO4 is addressed by utilizing complementary neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) approaches. This system is of interest because of the strong depression of the bulk superconducting transition at x=1/8 in association with charge and spin stripe order. The latter unidirectional order is tied to Cu-O bond-length anisotropy present in the so-called low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase. On warming, the lattice exhibits two sequential structural transitions, involving changes in the CuO6 tilt pattern, first to the low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) and then the high-temperature tetragonal (HTT) phase. Despite the changes in static order, inspection of the instantaneous local atomic structure suggests that the LTT-type tilts persist through the transitions. Analysis of the INS spectra for the x=1/8 composition reveals the dynamic nature of the LTT-like tilt fluctuations within the LTO and HTT phases. Within the low-temperature phase, the Cu-O bond-length splitting inferred from lattice symmetry and fitted atomic position parameters reaches a maximum of 0.3\% at x=1/8, suggesting that electron-phonon coupling may contribute to optimizing the structure to stabilize stripe order. This splitting is much too small to be resolved in the pair distribution function, and in fact we do not resolve any enhancement of the instantaneous bond-length distribution in association with stripe order. This study exemplifies the importance of a systematic approach using complementary techniques when investigating systems exhibiting a large degree of complexity and subtle structural responses.},

The Zr-W peak in the XPDF data has a weak temperature dependence and, hence, this linkage is relatively stiff and does not permit bending of the Zr-O-W link.

Three hierarchies of the atomic arrangement can be found: (i) five types of local coordination polyhedra for the single atoms, four of which are of Frank--Kasper type. In turn, they (ii) form a three-shell (Bergman) cluster containing 104 atoms, which is condensed sharing its outer shell with its neighbouring clusters, and (iii) a cluster connecting scheme corresponding to a three-dimensional tiling leaving space for a few glue atoms. Inside adjacent clusters, Y 8 cubes are tilted with respect to each other and thus allow for overall icosahedral symmetry. It is shown that the title compound is essentially isomorphic to its holmium analogue.

The unreacted polymer and heteroatoms induce mesoporosity by buffering the micropores created by polyaromatic domains. Raising the pyrolysis above 400 {$^\circ$}C releases the buffering material, thereby collapsing the mesopores.},

  abstract = {The observation of large negative magnetoresistive effects1,2,3 has generated tremendous scientific and technical interest in the perovskite manganites and related materials. These phenomena are commonly classified under the heading ``colossal magnetoresistance'' (CMR) to distinguish them from magnetoresistive effects in metals and metal-multilayers. CMR effects are observed in conjunction with the formation of a ferromagnetic metallic (FM) state at low temperatures and/or high magnetic fields. The close connection between the magnetism and the charge transport in these mixed-valence Mn3+n4+ materials is commonly believed to have its origin in the magnetic double-exchange interaction4'5in which itinerant eaelectrons mediate the ferromagnetic coupling between neighboring Mn core spins. Recent works have shown that double-exchange alone is insufficient to explain the extraordinary magnetoresistance values observed experimentally, so that electron-phonon interactions must also be invoked.6'7Alternatively, a direct Mn-Mn magnetic exchange interaction has been reported to better explain8the insensitivity of the Curie temperature (Tc) to the carrier concentration in oxygen-depleted samples.9This model also relies on strong electron-lattice coupling, which occurs via the Jahn-Teller (JT) mechanism10in which an Mn3+O6octahedron experiences a spontaneous distortion designed to break the degeneracy of its e5orbital, and thus lower the energy of its extra electron. If the coupling is strong, the electron may induce a significant local distortion of the lattice, which then follows the electron as it hops from site to site, thus forming a polaron.8,11,12},

  abstract = {Quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) materials hold promise for future electronics because of their unique band structures that result in electronic and mechanical properties sensitive to crystal strains in all three dimensions. Quantifying crystal strain is a prerequisite to correlating it with the performance of the device and calls for high resolution but spatially resolved rapid characterization methods. Here, we show that using fly-scan nano X-ray diffraction, we can accomplish a tensile strain sensitivity below 0.001\% with a spatial resolution of better than 80 nm over a spatial extent of 100 {$\mu$}m on quasi-2D flakes of 1T-TaS2. Coherent diffraction patterns were collected from a {$\sim$}100 nm thick sheet of 1T-TaS2 by scanning a 12 keV focused X-ray beam across and rotating the sample. We demonstrate that the strain distribution around micron- and submicron-sized ``bubbles'' that are present in the sample may be reconstructed from these images. The experiments use state-of-the-art synchrotron instrumentation and will allow rapid and nonintrusive strain mapping of thin-film samples and electronic devices based on quasi-2D materials.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is one of the fastest-growing topics in materials data science, with rapidly emerging applications spanning atomistic, image-based, spectral, and textual data modalities. DL allows analysis of unstructured data and automated identification of features. The recent development of large materials databases has fueled the application of DL methods in atomistic prediction in particular. In contrast, advances in image and spectral data have largely leveraged synthetic data enabled by high-quality forward models as well as by generative unsupervised DL methods. In this article, we present a high-level overview of deep learning methods followed by a detailed discussion of recent developments of deep learning in atomistic simulation, materials imaging, spectral analysis, and natural language processing. For each modality we discuss applications involving both theoretical and experimental data, typical modeling approaches with their strengths and limitations, and relevant publicly available software and datasets. We conclude the review with a discussion of recent cross-cutting work related to uncertainty quantification in this field and a brief perspective on limitations, challenges, and potential growth areas for DL methods in materials science.},

Pair distribution function analysis of X-ray diffraction data, ligand exchange experiments, and NMR molecular weight analyses suggest the nanocrystal core changes minimally among these clusters despite significant changes to their absorption and luminescence spectra. Photoluminescence excitation spectra obtained at 77 K reveal an energy transfer process between the surface-trapped excited state and the naphthalene-containing ligands that leads to ligand phosphorescence. A Dexter energy transfer mechanism is proposed to explain the observation of ligand phosphorescence on excitation of the cluster. These compounds demonstrate that cluster absorption and trap luminescence can be controlled with surface coordination chemistry.},

Here we report a careful temperature-dependent pair distribution function (PDF) analysis that showed that copper oxide, at about 200 K, exhibits geometric distortions of the tetrahedral units, probably related to a change in the solid angle of the polyhedra. Silver oxide, on the other hand, showed the same distortions even at the lowest temperature measured (10 K): structural refinements of the PDF confirmed the presence of local distortions (below 10 {\AA}) at all temperatures.},

Here we demonstrate an approach that accomplishes this using high energy X-rays coupled with total scattering pair distribution function (TSPDF) analysis by studying samples of sulfamerazine, a sulfonamide antibiotic drug, recrystallizing from a cryomilled-induced amorphous state. Samples milled under different conditions were shown to have significantly different phase compositions. The initial amorphous state was obtained by cryomilling the stable Form 1 polymorph. This was then aged at low temperature to initiate controlled recrystallization. We show that depending on the milling and aging protocol we see a mixture of amorphous material with the metastable Form 2 polymorph. A minority of Form 1 is also observed. We describe the approach that allowed us to quantify the phase fractions despite the majority of the sample lacking crystalline order.},

Rigidity theory provides a useful foundation for both aDGPs and uDGPs, though it is restricted to generic realizations of graphs, and key results are summarized. Conditions for unique realization are discussed for aDGP and uDGP cases, build-up algorithms for both cases are described and experimental results for uDGP are presented.},

  abstract = {Underneath the Bragg Peaks: Structural Analysis of Complex Materials focuses on the structural determination of crystalline solids with extensive disorder. Well-established methods exist for characterizing the structure of fully crystalline solids or fully disordered materials such as liquids and glasses, but there is a dearth of techniques for the cases in-between, crystalline solids with internal atomic and nanometer scale disorder. Egami and Billinge discuss how to fill the gap using modern tools of structural characterization. This problem is encountered in the structural characterization of a surprisingly wide range of complex materials of interest to modern technology and is becoming increasingly important. Takeshi Egami received the 2003 Eugene Bertram Warren Diffraction Physics Award for the work described in the book. The authors received 2010 J. D.

However, this assumption is valid only with respect to the periodic lattice structure. Actually, high-Q space is full of information on the local atomic structure that could be of major importance in some cases. We discuss high energy x-ray or neutron scattering as the methods of obtaining the data from the high-Q space, and the atomic pair-distribution function (PDF) analysis as the means of extracting information from such data. Preliminary data of our recent high-energy x-ray scattering measurement on a MX compound are shown for which this type of analysis is likely to play a significant role in understanding the properties.},

However, some other probes do not detect such an anomaly. Moreover, its relevance to the mechanism of superconductivity has been controversial. Based upon our pulsed neutron scattering studies we suggest that this confusing state of affairs is due primarily to the highly localized and dynamic nature of the lattice distortion which produces the anomaly. The magnitude of the distortion is too large to be dismissed merely as a consequence of the superconducting transition. We suggest that the distortions represent polarons or bi-polarons, and that they play a crucial role in superconductivity.},

By providing unprecedented resolution in real space, reciprocal space, and time, new techniques address materials characterization challenges beyond anything possible before, at length scales ranging from the atomic scale to the mesoscale, and at times as short as femtoseconds. The high degree of coherence of third-generation synchrotron sources permits a new level of precision in the quantitative description and analysis of diffraction and scattering and allows beams with sizes probing individual nanostructures to be produced. As a result, in situx-ray and neutron analysis techniques now provide insight into the structure of nanomaterials and yield a more precise set of metrics describing the nanometer-scale structure of materials. Time resolution and in situ studies allow application of these techniques to materials driven far from equilibrium and to the challenging environment associated with materials processing.},

Whereas catalyst films formed in borate electrolyte (CoBi) exhibit coherent domains consisting of 3--4 nm cobaltate clusters with up to three layers, films deposited in phosphate electrolyte (CoPi) comprise significantly smaller clusters that are not coherently stacked. These structural insights are correlated with marked differences in activity between CoPi and CoBi films.},

Furthermore, we identify the signatures of systematic errors that may occur during data reduction and show that atomic positions refined from UEC are robust to these errors.

Most of these systems, however, are non-magnetic, motivating a search for anisotropic materials where the coupling of charge and spin may affect emergent quantum states. Here, electron doping the van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr induces an electronically driven quasi-1D CDW, which survives above room temperature. Lithium intercalation also increases the magnetic ordering temperature to 200 K and changes its interlayer magnetic coupling from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. The spin-polarized nature of the anisotropic bands that give rise to this CDW enforces an intrinsic coupling of charge and spin. The coexistence and interplay of ferromagnetism and charge modulation in this exfoliatable material provides a promising platform for studying tunable quantum phenomena across a range of temperatures and thicknesses.},

  abstract = {Under the Dome The superconducting transition temperature Tc of copper oxides has a dome-shaped dependence on chemical doping. Whether there is a quantum critical point (QCP) beneath the dome, and whether it is related to the enigmatic pseudogap, has been heavily debated. Two papers address this question in two different families of Bi-based cuprates. In (Bi,Pb)2(Sr,La)2CuO6+{$\delta$}, He et al. (p. 608) found that the Fermi surface (FS) undergoes a topological change as doping is increased, which points to the existence of a QCP at a doping close to the maximum in Tc, seemingly uncorrelated with the pseudogap. Fujita et al. (p. 612) studied a range of dopings in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{$\delta$} to find an FS reconstruction simultaneous with the disappearance of both rotational and translational symmetry breaking, the latter of which has been associated with the pseudogap. These findings point to a concealed QCP. The existence of electronic symmetry breaking in the underdoped cuprates and its disappearance with increased hole density p are now widely reported. However, the relation between this transition and the momentum-space {$<$}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/344/6184/612/embed/mml-math-1.gif"/{$>$} electronic structure underpinning the superconductivity has not yet been established.

Furthermore, for larger metal particles ({$>$}2 nm) where diffraction patterns of the metallic phase are obtainable in air, we show that on exposure to air the surface is oxidized with a metallic core producing misleading results with respect to particle size and lattice parameter. Results from XRD are cross-correlated with scanning transmission electron microscopy and three other synchrotron X-ray techniques, small angle diffraction (SAXS), pair distribution function (PDF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), to provide detailed characterization of the structure of very small nanoparticles in the metallic phase.},

In the first stage, an alternating non-negative least-squares framework is used in combination with the active set method with a warm-start strategy for the solution of subproblems. In the second stage, an interior point method is adopted to accelerate the local convergence. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved. The new algorithm is compared with some existing algorithms in benchmark tests using both real-world data and synthetic data.

Structural characterization was accomplished using state-of-the-art analytical methods available for clays. The results illustrate the status of techniques for clay structure determination, as well as providing a structural model for illite. The chemical formula for the illite-1M under investigation can be written as K0.78Ca0.02Na0.02(Mg0.34Al1.69FeIII0.02)[Si3.35Al0.65]O10(OH)2{$\cdot$}nH2O. Structure simulations with WILDFIRE yielded a model with 30\% of cis-vacant layers and an expandability percentage of 10\%. The value of the percentage of expandability was confirmed with NEWMOD, with which the best simulation was obtained with 90\% of di-octahedral mica with K (80\% site population) in the interlayer region and 10\% of expandable layers. The best structure simulation obtained with DIFFaX was also obtained with a population of K atoms of 80\%, six cells along c (in agreement with the results of a transmission electron microscopy study) and an average dimension of the particles in the ab plane of 300\>nm. Besides the determination of the basic structure unit (the results are consistent with those obtained with the local information provided by a fit of the pair distribution function data) and the model of disorder, refinement with DIFFaX+ allowed the calculation of a possible position for the interlayer water molecule. Although physically sound, both the observed tetrahedral layer corrugation and the location of the water molecule need further experimental evidence, because the final fit of the observed pattern is still imperfect. The reasons for this misfit are discussed.},

We find that all the investigated La2-xBaxCuO4 samples exhibit static spin-stripe order and that the quasi-two-dimensional superconducting (SC) transition temperature Tc1 and the static spin-stripe order temperature Tso have very similar values throughout the phase diagram. Moreover, the magnetic and the SC properties of the x=0.155 (LBCO-0.155) and x=0.17 (LBCO-0.17) samples were studied under hydrostatic pressure. As a remarkable result, in these bulk cuprate superconductors, the three-dimensional SC transition temperature Tc and Tso nearly coincide [Tc(p){$\simeq$}Tso(p)] at all pressure investigated (0{$\leq$}p{$\leq$}2.3 GPa). We also observed a pressure induced transition from long-range spin stripe order to a disordered magnetic state at p\ding{73}{$\simeq$}1.6 GPa in LBCO-0.155, coexisting with a SC state with substantial superfluid density. In LBCO-0.17, a disordered magnetic state is present at all p. The present results indicate that static magnetic order and SC pairing correlations develop in a cooperative fashion in La2-xBaxCuO4, and provide a new route of understanding the complex interplay between static magnetism and superconductivity in the stripe phase of cuprates.},

A strong reduction of the in-plane and out-of-plane lattice constants is observed under pressure. However, no indication of any pressure-induced phase transition from T{$\prime$} to the K2NiF4 (the so-called T) structure is observed up to the maximum applied pressure of p = 11 GPa. Large and nonlinear increase of the short-range magnetic order temperature Tso in T{$\prime-$}Pr1.3-xLa0.7CexCuO4 (x=0.1) was observed under pressure. Simultaneous pressure causes a nonlinear decrease of the SC transition temperature Tc. All these experiments establish the short-range magnetic order as an intrinsic and competing phase in SC T{$\prime-$}Pr1.3-xLa0.7CexCuO4 (x=0.1). The observed pressure effects may be interpreted in terms of the improved nesting conditions through the reduction of the in-plane and out-of-plane lattice constants upon hydrostatic pressure.},

Here we present a novel approach that uses a generative machine learning model based on a Diffusion model that is trained on 45,229 known structures. The model factors both the measured diffraction pattern as well as relevant statistical priors on the unit cell of atomic cluster structures. Conditioned only on the chemical formula and the information-scarce finite-size broadened powder diffraction pattern, we find that our model, PXRDnet, can successfully solve simulated nanocrystals as small as 10 angstroms across 200 materials of varying symmetry and complexity, including structures from all seven crystal systems. We show that our model can determine structural solutions with up to \$81.5{\textbackslash}\%\$ accuracy, as measured by structural correlation. Furthermore, PXRDnet is capable of solving structures from noisy diffraction patterns gathered in real-world experiments. We suggest that data driven approaches, bootstrapped from theoretical simulation, will ultimately provide a path towards determining the structure of previously unsolved nano-materials.},

  abstract = {Powder crystallography is the experimental science of determining the structure of molecules provided in crystalline-powder form, by analyzing their x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Since many materials are readily available as crystalline powder, powder crystallography is of growing usefulness to many fields. However, powder crystallography does not have an analytically known solution, and therefore the structural inference typically involves a laborious process of iterative design, structural refinement, and domain knowledge of skilled experts. A key obstacle to fully automating the inference process computationally has been formulating the problem in an end-to-end quantitative form that is suitable for machine learning, while capturing the ambiguities around molecule orientation, symmetries, and reconstruction resolution. Here we present an ML approach for structure determination from powder diffraction data. It works by estimating the electron density in a unit cell using a variational coordinate-based deep neural network. We demonstrate the approach on computed powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), along with partial chemical composition information, as input. When evaluated on theoretically simulated data for the cubic and trigonal crystal systems, the system achieves up to 93.4\% average similarity (as measured by structural similarity index) with the ground truth on unseen materials, both with known and partially-known chemical composition information, showing great promise for successful structure solution even from degraded and incomplete input data. The approach does not presuppose a crystalline structure and the approach are readily extended to other situations such as nanomaterials and textured samples, paving the way to reconstruction of yet unresolved nanostructures.},

It addresses signal variability caused by stretching, proving beneficial for analyzing data such as powder diffraction at varying temperatures. This approach provides a more meaningful decomposition, particularly when the component signals resemble those from chemical components in the sample. The stretchedNMF model introduces a stretching factor to accommodate signal expansion, solved using discretization and Block Coordinate Descent algorithms. Initial experimental results indicate that the stretchedNMF model outperforms conventional NMF for datasets exhibiting such expansion. An enhanced version, sparse-stretchedNMF, optimized for powder diffraction data from crystalline materials, leverages signal sparsity for accurate extraction, especially with small stretches. Experimental results showcase its effectiveness in analyzing diffraction data, including success in real-time chemical reaction experiments.},

The sample containing 16O undergoes an insulator--metal (IM) transition below 100 K while the sample substituted with 18O remains insulating at all temperatures.

We demonstrate the utility of the method by constructing catalytic activity maps of different alloyed elements and use X-ray scattering analysis by the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) method to gain insight into the structures of the most active compositions. Among combinations of four elements (Au, Ag, Cu, Zn), Au6Ag2Cu2 and Au4Zn3Cu3 were identified as the most active compositions in their respective ternaries. These ternary electrocatalysts were more active than any binary combination, and a ca. 5-fold increase in current density at potentials of -0.4 to -0.8\,V vs. RHE was obtained for the best ternary catalysts relative to Au prepared by the same method. Tafel plots of electrochemical data for CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution indicate that the ternary catalysts, despite their higher surface area, are poorer catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction than pure Au. This results in high Faradaic efficiency for CO2 reduction to CO.},

While local probes see little change in bonding, in contrast, average structure probes imply a displacive transition. Here we use high energy X-ray scattering to develop a model consistent with both the local and average structure pictures. We detect a correlation length for domains of the R3m structure which shows power law decay upon heating. Unlike a classical soft mode, it saturates at ca. 20 \{{\textbackslash}AA\} above Tc. These nanoclusters are too small to be observed by standard diffraction techniques, yet contain the same local motif as the room temperature structure, explaining previous discrepancies. Finally, a careful analysis of the pair distribution functions implies that the 0.6 \% negative thermal expansion (NTE) at the R3m -Fm-3m transition is associated with the loss of coherence between these domains.},

They are able to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction in acidic solutions but with only modest activity when prepared by constant anodic potential deposition. We now show that the performance of these catalysts is improved when they are ``activated'' by potential cycling protocols, as measured by Tafel analysis (where lower slope is better): upon activation the Tafel slope decreases from {$\sim$}120 to {$\sim$}70 mV/decade in neutral conditions and from {$\sim$}650 to {$\sim$}90 mV/decade in acidic solutions. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and structural methods were employed to study the activation process and support a mechanism where the original birnessite-like MnOx ({$\delta$}-MnO2) undergoes a phase change, induced by comproportionation with cathodically generated Mn(OH)2, to a hausmannite-like intermediate ({$\alpha$}-Mn3O4). Subsequent anodic conditioning from voltage cycling or water oxidation produces a disordered birnessite-like phase, which is highly active for oxygen evolution. At pH 2.5, the current density of activated MnOx (at an overpotential of 600 mV) is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the original MnOx and begins to approach that of Ru and Ir oxides in acid.},

  abstract = {Local symmetry breaking in complex materials is emerging as an important contributor to materials properties but is inherently difficult to study. Here we follow up an earlier structural observation of such a local symmetry broken phase in the technologically important compound PbTe with a study of the lattice dynamics using inelastic neutron scattering (INS). We show that the lattice dynamics are responsive to the local symmetry broken phase, giving key insights in the behavior of PbTe, but also revealing INS as a powerful tool for studying local structure. The new result is the observation of the unexpected appearance upon warming of a new zone center phonon branch in PbTe. In a harmonic solid the number of phonon branches is strictly determined by the contents and symmetry of the unit cell. The appearance of the new mode indicates a crossover to a dynamic lower symmetry structure with increasing temperature. No structural transition is seen crystallographically, but the appearance of the new mode in inelastic neutron scattering coincides with the observation of local Pb off-centering dipoles observed in the local structure. The observation resembles relaxor ferroelectricity, but since there are no inhomogeneous dopants in pure PbTe this anomalous behavior is an intrinsic response of the system. We call such an appearance of dipoles out of a nondipolar ground-state ``emphanisis'' meaning the appearance out of nothing. It cannot be explained within the framework of conventional phase transition theories such as soft-mode theory and challenges our basic understanding of the physics of materials.},

Effective conservation requires detailed knowledge of the distribution and chemical nature of these species to develop strategies for preventing multiple chemo-mechanical degradation pathways. Here, we apply synchrotron-based computed tomography total scattering methods to the Mary Rose keelson wood that provides valuable position-resolved structural information on multiple embedded species of different length and concentration scales. We identify 5 nm zinc sulfide nanoparticles in the wood, presumably deposits from bacteria operating on the sulfur energy cycle under the anaerobic conditions on the seabed. These are identified as precursors to acid attack on the wood upon removal to an aerobic environment. These insights inform not only next-generation conservation strategies, but also the efficacy and unforeseen issues of previous treatments.},

The local structure of the precursor in solution is similar to that of the crystalline coordination polymer [Fe(H2cit(H2O)]n, where corner-sharing [FeO6] octahedra are linked by citrate. As hydrothermal treatment of the solution is initiated, clusters of edge-sharing [FeO6] units form (with extent of the structural order {$<$}5 {\AA}). Tetrahedrally coordinated iron subsequently appears, and as the synthesis continues, the clusters slowly assemble into crystalline maghemite, giving rise to clear Bragg peaks after 90 s at 320 {$^\circ$}C. The primary transformation from amorphous clusters to nanocrystallites takes place by condensation of the clusters along the corner-sharing tetrahedral iron units. The crystallization process is related to large changes in the local structure as the interatomic distances in the clusters change dramatically with cluster growth. The local atomic structure is size dependent, and particles smaller than 6 nm are highly disordered. The final crystallite size ({$<$}10 nm) is dependent on both synthesis temperature and precursor concentration.},

We have measured the PDFs of Ni and InAs using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The analysis of the Ni data allowed us to determine the Debye temperature which is in good agreement with values found in the literature. In contrast to the isotropic metallic bonding in Ni resulting in a relatively weak correlation between the motion of neighboring atoms, we found a very strong correlation in InAs as one might expect from the covalent bond between In and As. The results are compared with theoretical predictions by Chung and Thorpe (Phys. Rev. B 1977, 55, 1545).},

  abstract = {Pure, crystalline, {$\sim$}10 nm lithium ferrite phase (Li0.5Fe2.5O4), was successfully synthesized at very low temperature using a modified combustion method. The crystal structure and microstructure evolution of this system upon annealing were monitored by a careful investigation of X-ray diffractograms collected on a synchrotron source. Comparative analysis of the results obtained from the full profile Rietveld method (in reciprocal space) and the pair distribution function method (in direct space) was carried out. Nanocrystalline samples exhibit similar crystal structure, on average, with a partial ordering of Li+ and Fe3+ ions between octahedral 4b and 12d sites on the spinel crystal lattice (space group P4332). After annealing at 973 K, cation distribution changes to a completely ordered, resembling that which is seen in the bulk lithium ferrite. The PDF analysis reveals abnormally high values of oxygen atomic displacement parameters in tetrahedral 8c sites (O1) indicating a significant disordering of the O1 network and suggests migration of lithium ions from 4b sites to the outer layers of nanoparticles. Analysis of room temperature M{\"o}ssbauer spectra has shown that the hyperfine field for Fe3+ ions in tetrahedral 8c sites is the most sensitive on increasing the particle size and improving the crystallinity. From the differential thermal analysis, it was found that a lower driving force is required to induce an order-disorder phase transition in nanocrysalline samples, compared to the bulk-like sample, presumably due to the higher crystal disordering in these samples.},

For crystalline materials with regular repeat structural units, X-ray crystallography can provide this information. Many nanoscale materials contain no regular repeats, so new ways of determining their atomic structure are needed. A group from Michigan State University has developed a technique in which nanomaterial structure may be solved from a list of the precise distances between atoms in the cluster, acquired from X-ray or neutron diffraction data. These data contain no orientational or three-body information, yet can be used to obtain three-dimensional structures, using appropriate algorithms. Two approaches show promise: a `genetic' algorithm, taking a lead from mating crossovers, and the new `Liga' algorithm, inspired by the promotion and relegation of teams in soccer leagues.},

  abstract = {Computational techniques for nanostructure determination of substances that resist standard crystallographic methods are often laborious processes starting from initial guess solutions not derived from experimental data. The Liga algorithm can create nanostructures using only lists of lengths or distances between atom pairs, providing an experimental basis for starting structures. These distance lists may be extracted from a variety of experimental probes and we illustrate the procedure with distances determined from the pair distribution function. Candidate subclusters that are a subset of a structure's atoms compete based on adherence to the length list. Atoms are added to well performing candidates and removed from poor ones, until a complete structure with sufficient agreement to the length list emerges. The Liga algorithm is shown to reliably recreate Lennard--Jones clusters from ideal length lists and the C60 structure from neutron-scattering data. The correct fullerene structure was obtained with experimental data which missed several distances and had loosened constraints on distance multiplicity. This suggests that the Liga algorithm may have robust applicability for a wide range of nanostructures even in the absence of ideal data.},

In comparison to the preceding programs, PDFgetX3 requires fewer inputs, less user experience and can be readily adopted by novice users. The live-plotting interactive feature allows to assess the effects of calculation parameters and select their optimum values. PDFgetX3 uses an ad-hoc data correction method, where the slowly-changing structure independent signal is filtered out to obtain coherent X-ray intensities that contain structure information. The outputs from PDFgetX3 have been verified by processing experimental PDFs from inorganic, organic and nanosized samples and comparing them to their counterparts from previous established software. In spite of different algorithm, the obtained PDFs were nearly identical and yielded highly similar results when used in structure refinement. PDFgetX3 is written in Python language and features well documented, reusable codebase. The software can be used either as standalone application or as a library of PDF-processing functions that can be called on from other Python scripts. The software is free for open academic research, but requires paid license for commercial use.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive study has been undertaken to establish the primary factors that control transport of oxygen and nitrogen in polymer-derived carbogenic molecular sieves (CMS). Characterization of the nanostructure of CMS derived from poly(furfuryl alcohol) (PFA) indicates that significant physical and chemical reorganization occurs as a function of synthesis temperature. Spectroscopic measurements show a drastic decrease in oxygen and hydrogen functionality with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Structural reorganization and elimination of these heteroatoms lead to a measurable increase in the unpaired electron density in these materials. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and powder neutron diffraction are used to probe the corresponding changes in the physical structural features in the CMS. These indicate that as the pyrolysis temperature is increased, the structure of the CMS transforms from one that is disordered and therefore highly symmetric to one that is more ordered on a length scale of 15 {\AA} and hence less symmetric. This structural transformation process, one of symmetry breaking and pattern formation, is often observed in other nonlinear dissipative systems, but not in solids. Symmetry breaking provides the driving force for these high-temperature reorganizations, but unlike most dissipative systems, these less-symmetric structures remain frozen in place when energy is no longer applied. The impact of these nanostructural reorganizations on the molecular sieving character of the CMS is studied in terms of the physical separation of oxygen and nitrogen. These results show that the effective diffusivities of oxygen and nitrogen in the CMS vary by more than an order of magnitude across the range of synthesis temperatures studied. Although the electronic nature of the CMS leads to higher equilibrium capacity for oxygen, it is the physical nanostructure which governs the separation of these two molecules. It is concluded that the primary separation mechanism is steric and configurational in nature, a conclusion in good agreement with the general features of the kinetic hypothesis conjectured by earlier workers.},

The tools are applied to both ex situ and operando PDF data for 3 nm \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{TiO\_\{2\}\}\$-bronze nanocrystals, which function as the active electrode material in a Li-ion battery. The tools enable structural modelling of the ex situ and operando PDF data, revealing two pristine \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{TiO\_\{2\}\}\$ phases (bronze and anatase) and two lithiated \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Li\_\{x\}TiO\_\{2\}\}\$ phases (lithiated versions of bronze and anatase), and the phase evolution during Galvanostatic cycling is characterized.},

Local atomic distortions in the Te nets due to the CDW are larger than observed crystallographically, resulting in distinct short and long Te-Te bonds. Observation of different distortion amplitudes in the local and average structures is explained by the discommensurated nature of the CDW, since the pair distribution function is sensitive to the local displacements within the commensurate regions, whereas the crystallographic result averages over many discommensurated domains. The result is supported by STM data. This is the first quantitative local structural study within the commensurate domains in an IC-CDW system.},

Our analysis first shows that ultra-small tungsten and niobium oxide nanoparticles form instantaneously upon heating, with sizes between 1.5 and 2?nm. We show that the main structural motifs in the nanoparticles can be described with structures containing pentagonal columns, which is characteristic for many bulk tungsten and niobium oxides. We furthermore elucidate the structure of the precursor complex as clusters of octahedra with O- and Cl-ligands. The PCC based methodology automates the structure characterization and proves useful for analysis of large datasets of for example, time resolved X-ray scattering studies. The PCC is implemented in ?PDF in the cloud?, a web platform for PDF analysis.},

We first apply DeepStruc to PDFs from seven different structure types of monometallic nanoparticles, and show that structures can be solved from both simulated and experimental PDFs, including PDFs from nanoparticles that are not present in the training distribution. We also apply DeepStruc to a system of hcp, fcc and stacking faulted nanoparticles, where DeepStruc recognizes stacking faulted nanoparticles as an interpolation between hcp and fcc nanoparticles and is able to solve stacking faulted structures from PDFs. Our findings suggests that DeepStruc is a step towards a general approach for structure solution of nanomaterials.},

Modern synchrotrons can produce up to 1 petabyte of data per day. Such amounts of data can speed up materials development, but also comes with a staggering growth in workload, as the data generated must be stored and analyzed. We present an approach for quickly identifying an atomic structure model from pair distribution function (PDF) data from (nano)crystalline materials. Our model, MLstructureMining, uses a tree-based machine learning (ML) classifier. MLstructureMining has been trained to classify chemical structures from a PDF and gives a top-3 accuracy of 99\% on simulated PDFs not seen during training, with a total of 6,062 possible classes. We also demonstrate that MLstructureMining can identify the chemical structure from experimental PDFs from nanoparticles of CoFe2O4 and CeO2, and we show how it can be used to treat an in situ PDF series collected during Bi2Fe4O9 formation. Additionally, we show how MLstructureMining can be used in combination with the well-known methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to analyze data from in situ experiments. MLstructureMining thus allows for real-time structure characterization by screening vast quantities of crystallographic information files in seconds.},

The dimers persist up to 350 K, well above the insulator-metal transition, with {$\Delta$}r decreasing in magnitude on warming.

We use ultrafast electron diffraction to probe the lattice interactions with electronic degrees of freedom in superconducting FeSe and find a significant lattice response to local nematicity. We observe that a perturbation by a laser pulse leads to a surprising enhancement of the high-symmetry crystalline order as a result of suppression of low-symmetry local lattice distortions, which are signatures of nematic fluctuations. The distortions are present at temperatures both below and above the nematic phase transition, as corroborated by our x-ray pair distribution function analysis and transmission electron microscopy measurements. Nonequilibrium lattice behavior of FeSe reveals two distinct time scales of nematic response to photoexcitation, 130(20) and 40(10) ps, corresponding to diffusive and percolative dynamics of nematic fluctuations respectively.},

Many studies of both the crystal structure and the local structure of the Lai.xMxMnO3 (with M = Ca, Sr and Ba, as well as Pb) system have now been carried out. As expected, these systems all show a strong coupling of the lattice to the CMR transition. On the other hand, neutron diffraction data and x-ray absorption studies for the Ti2mn2O7 pyrochlore, which also exhibits CMR, shows no deviations from ideal stoichiometry, mixed valency, or Jahn-Teller distortions of the MnO6 octahedron.

  abstract = {Polarized Raman scattering measurements on IrTe2 single crystals carried out over the 15--640 K temperature range, and across the structural phase transition, reveal different insights regarding the crystal symmetry. In the high temperature regime three Raman active modes are observed at all of the studied temperatures above the structural phase transition, rather than two as predicted by the factor group analysis for the assumed P3{\textasciimacron}m1 symmetry. This indicates that the actual symmetry of the high temperature phase is lower than previously thought. The observation of an additional Eg mode at high temperature can be explained by doubling of the original trigonal unit cell along the c axis and within the P3{\textasciimacron}c1 symmetry. In the low temperature regime (below 245 K) the other Raman modes appear as a consequence of the symmetry lowering phase transition and the corresponding increase of the primitive cell. All of the modes observed below the phase transition temperature can be assigned within the monoclinic crystal symmetry. The temperature dependence of the Raman active phonons in both phases is mainly driven by anharmonicity effects. The results call for reconsideration of the crystallographic phases of IrTe2.},

The purpose of this teaching module is to make the introduction of electrochemistry accessible to undergraduate laboratories, especially those with limited financial resources and without expertise in electronics or programming. The electronic circuit components for the potentiostat are readily available and easy to assemble. The graphical user interface replaces any programming-based interface, displays data in real time, and interacts with user commands. The software package is a stand-alone executable file that is compatible with any PC and is provided in the Supporting Information. Cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, and chronoamperometry functions are demonstrated with representative electrochemical experiments, and the data obtained are comparable to those obtained with a research-grade potentiostat. This teaching module is user-friendly so that it can be easily adapted into the undergraduate classroom. We make available in the Supporting Information all of the necessary instructions and information, including schematics for the potentiostat, circuit layout, electronic components, case fabrication, step-by-step instructions for assembly, software user interface, and detailed operating instructions.},

Here, we report a novel series of glass-forming metal--ethylenebis(acetamide) networks that undergo reversible glass and crystallization transitions below 200 {$^\circ$}C. The glass-transition temperatures, crystallization kinetics, and glass stability of these materials are readily tunable, either by synthetic modification or by liquid-phase blending, to form binary glasses. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis reveals extended structural correlations in both single and binary metal--bis(acetamide) glasses and highlights the important role of metal--metal correlations during structural evolution across glass--crystal transitions. Notably, the glass and crystalline phases of a Co--ethylenebis(acetamide) binary network feature a large reflectivity contrast ratio of 4.8 that results from changes in the local coordination environment around Co centers. These results provide new insights into glass--crystal transitions in metal--organic materials and have exciting implications for optical switching, rewritable data storage, and functional glass ceramics.},

  abstract = {The prospect of creating ferroelectric or high permittivity nanomaterials provides motivation for investigating complex transition metal oxides of the form Ba(Ti, MV)O3, where M = Nb or Ta. Solid state processing typically produces mixtures of crystalline phases, rarely beyond minimally doped Nb/Ta. Using a modified sol-gel method, we prepared single phase nanocrystals of Ba(Ti, M)O3. Compositional and elemental analysis puts the empirical formulas close to BaTi0.5Nb0.5O3-{$\delta$} and BaTi0.5Ta0.5O3-{$\delta$}. For both materials, a reversible temperature dependent phase transition (non-centrosymmetric to symmetric) is observed in the Raman spectrum in the region 533--583~K (260--310~{$^\circ$}C); for Ba(Ti, Nb)O3, the onset is at 543~K (270~{$^\circ$}C); and for Ba(Ti, Ta)O3, the onset is at 533~K (260~{$^\circ$}C), which are comparable with 390--393~K (117--120~{$^\circ$}C) for bulk BaTiO3. The crystal structure was resolved by examination of the powder x-ray diffraction and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of synchrotron total scattering data. It was postulated whether the structure adopted at the nanoscale was single or double perovskite. Double perovskites (A2B{$\prime$}B{${''}$}O6) are characterized by the type and extent of cation ordering, which gives rise to higher symmetry crystal structures. PDF analysis was used to examine all likely candidate structures and to look for evidence of higher symmetry. The feasible phase space that evolves includes the ordered double perovskite structure Ba2(Ti, MV)O6 (M = Nb, Ta) Fm-3m, a disordered cubic structure, as a suitable high temperature analog, Ba(Ti, MV)O3 Pm-3m, and an orthorhombic Ba(Ti, MV)O3 Amm2, a room temperature structure that presents an unusually high level of lattice displacement, possibly due to octahedral tilting, and indication of a highly polarized crystal.},

There is a general consensus that preparing stable glasses requires the use of high substrate temperatures close to the glass transition one, Tg. Here, we challenge this empirical rule by showing the formation of Zr-based ultrastable metallic glasses (MGs) at room temperature, i.e., with a substrate temperature of only 0.43Tg. By carefully controlling the deposition rate, we can improve the stability of the obtained glasses to higher values. In contrast to conventional quenched glasses, the ultrastable MGs exhibit a large increase of Tg of {$\sim$}60\,K, stronger resistance against crystallization, and more homogeneous structure with less order at longer distances. Our study circumvents the limitation of substrate temperature for developing ultrastable glasses, and provides deeper insight into glasses stability and their surface dynamics.},

Starting from this discovery, a huge amount of experimental data have been accumulated. This important corpus of results will allow the development of suitable theoretical models aimed at describing the basic electronic structure properties and nature of superconducting states in these fascinating new systems. A close correlation between structural features and physical properties of the normal and superconducting states has already been demonstrated in the current literature. Advanced theoretical models are also based on the close correlation with structural properties and in particular with the Fe--As tetrahedral array. As for other complex materials, a deeper understanding of their structure--properties correlation requires a full knowledge of the atomic arrangement within the structure. Here we report an investigation of the local structure in the SmFeAsO 1 - x F x system carried out by means of x-ray total scattering measurements and pair distribution function analysis. The results presented indicate that the local structure of these HTSC significantly differs from the average structure determined by means of traditional diffraction techniques, in particular the distribution of Fe--As bond lengths. In addition, a model for describing the observed discrepancies is presented.},

  abstract = {The YNiO3 nickelate is a paradigm {$d$}-electron oxide that manifests the intriguing temperature-mediated sequence of three phases transitions from (i) magnetically ordered insulator to (ii) paramagnetic (PM) insulator and then to (iii) PM metal. Such phenomena raised the question of the nature of the association of magnetism and structural symmetry breaking with the appearance in (i) and (ii) and disappearance in (iii) of insulating band gaps. It is demonstrated here that first-principles mean-field--like density-functional theory (DFT), driven by molecular dynamics temperature evolution, can describe not only the origin of the magnetically long-range ordered insulating phase (i), but also the creation of an insulating paramagnet (ii) that lacks spin- long-range order, and of a metallic paramagnet (iii) as temperature rises. This approach provides the patterns of structural and magnetic symmetry breaking at different temperatures, in parallel with band gaps obtained when the evolving geometries are used as input to DFT electronic band-structure calculations. This disentangles the complex interplay among spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom. Analysis shows that the success in describing the rise and fall of the insulating band gaps along the phase transition sequence is enabled by allowing sufficient flexibility in describing diverse local structural and magnetic motifs as input to DFT. This entails the use of sufficiently large supercells that allow expressing structural disproportionation of octahedra, as well as a description of PM phases as a distribution of local magnetic moments (rather than using a single averaged moment). It appears that the historic dismissal of mean-field--like DFT as being unable to describe such Mott-like transitions was premature, as it was based on consideration of averaged crystallographic unit cells, a description that washes out local symmetry-breaking motifs. The magnetically ordered insulating phase (i) and the PM insulating phase (ii) result in DFT from allowing symmetry breaking, evident already by considering the athermal internal energy. In contrast, the PM metallic phase (iii) is formed thermally by smearing out thus weakening symmetry breaking. Analysis of snapshots of the different forms of structural vs magnetic symmetry breaking shows that only the loss of the polymorphous distribution of magnetic moments existing in (ii) causes the fall of the band gap, resulting in the metallic state in (iii). The interesting conclusion is that such a description of the rise [in phases (i) and (ii)] and fall [in phase (iii)] of the insulating gap does not rely on the traditional Mott-like strong correlation understanding, but on breaking and remaking of magnetic and structural symmetries reflected in energy lowering.},

Additionally, FreD, SprayD, BallM, and SpinMeltQ exhibited an exothermic cold crystallization peak, but MeltQ did not.

  abstract = {Researchers have reported that freeze-dried (FreD), spray-dried (SprayD), and ball milled (BallM) amorphous sucrose exhibit cold crystallization, whereas melt-quenched (MeltQ) does not. Three main explanations have been proposed to account for the lack of MeltQ cold crystallization: absence of crystal nuclei, lower sample moisture content, and dissimilarity to the crystalline state. However, in light of recent research revealing the presence of thermal decomposition indicator compounds in MeltQ sucrose, but not in FreD and SprayD, it is our objective to determine if thermal decomposition is also a plausible explanation for the lack of MeltQ cold crystallization. To achieve this objective, the physicochemical characteristics and thermal behavior of freeze-dried melt-quenched amorphous sucrose (FreD-MeltQ) were compared to those of MeltQ and FreD. Despite similar physicochemical characteristics to FreD, FreD-MeltQ did not exhibit cold crystallization. Powder X-ray diffraction and total scattering pair distribution function analysis showed that MeltQ and FreD-MeltQ had a more similar local structure to one another than to FreD. The underlying cause of these structural differences appears to be the presence of thermal decomposition compounds, with MeltQ and FreD-MeltQ containing similar amounts of thermal decomposition indicator compounds (7--8\% glucose, 0.5--1\% fructose, 0.2\% 5-HMF, and 0.5\% 1-kestose) and FreD containing none. Based on this evidence, we assert that thermal decomposition is an additional factor that contributes to the lack of cold crystallization in MeltQ sucrose.},

Synchrotron X-ray characterization, coupled with first-principles calculations, show that phase stability is mediated by oxygen vacancy-induced structural distortions. These distortions are dependent on the local electric field intensity, validating a longstanding hypothesis that high local field strengths (exceeding 106 V m-1) act as a driving force in field-driven materials synthesis. This information linking field strength with atomic structure lays the foundation to deploy EM fields to explore regions of phase space and material properties not readily accessible in nature.},

Random forest models were trained on simulated XANES, PDF, and both combined to extract oxidation state, coordination number, and mean nearest-neighbor bond length. XANES-only models generally outperformed PDF-only models, even for structural tasks, although using the metal's differential PDFs (dPDFs) instead of total PDFs narrowed this gap. When combined with PDFs, information from XANES often dominates the prediction. Our results demonstrate that XANES contain rich structural information and highlight the utility of species-specificity.

  abstract = {Molten phases of metal--organic networks offer exciting opportunities for using coordination chemistry principles to access liquids and glasses with unique and tunable structures and properties. Here, we discuss general thermodynamic strategies to provide an increased enthalpic and entropic driving force for reversible, low-temperature melting transitions in extended coordination solids and illustrate this approach through a systematic study of a series of bis(acetamide)-based networks with record-low melting temperatures. The low melting temperatures of these compounds are the result of weak coordination bonds, conformationally flexible bridging ligands, and weak electrostatic interactions between spatially separated cations and anions, which collectively reduce the enthalpy and increase the entropy of fusion. Through a combination of crystallography, spectroscopy, and calorimetry, enthalpic trends are found to be dictated by the strength of coordination bonds and hydrogen bonds within each compound, while entropic trends are strongly influenced by the degree to which residual motion and positional disorder are restricted in the crystalline state. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis  of Co(bba)3[CoCl4] [bba = N,N{$\prime$}-1,4-butylenebis(acetamide)], which features a record-low melting temperature for a three-dimensional metal--organic network of 124 {$^\circ$}C, provide direct evidence of metal--ligand coordination in the liquid phase, as well as intermediate- and extended-range order that support its network-forming nature. In addition, rheological measurements are used to rationalize differences in glass-forming ability and relaxation dynamics. These results provide new insights into the structural and chemical factors that influence the thermodynamics of melting transitions of extended coordination solids, as well as the structure and properties of coordination network-forming liquids.},

  abstract = {Three different water-alcohol cosolvent systems were used to assemble mesoporous molecular sieve silicas with wormhole framework structures (previously denoted HMS silicas) from an electrically neutral amine surfactant (S{$^\circ$}) and a silicon alkoxide precursor (I{$^\circ$}). The fundamental particle size and associated textural (interparticle) porosity of the disordered structures were correlated with the solubility of the surfactant in the water-alcohol cosolvents used for the S{$^\circ$}I{$^\circ$} assembly process. Polar cosolvents containing relatively low volume fractions of CnH2n+1OH alcohols (n = 1-3) gave heterogeneous surfactant emulsions that assembled intergrown aggregates of small primary particles with high textural pore volumes (designated HMS-HTx). Conversely, three-dimensional, monolithic particles with little or no textural porosity (designated HMS-LTx) were formed from homogeneous surfactant solutions in lower polarity cosolvents. Aluminum substituted Al-HMS-HTx analogues with high textural porosity and improved framework accessibility also were shown to be much more efficient catalysts than Al-HMS-LTx or monolithic forms of hexagonal Al-MCM-41 for the sterically demanding condensed phase alkylation of 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol with cinnamyl alcohol. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies verified the textural differences between wormhole HMS and electrostatically assembled hexagonal MCM-41 and SBA-3 molecular sieves. Power law fits to the scattering data indicated a surface fractal (Ds = 2.76) for HMS-HTx, consistent with rough surfaces. A second power law at lower-q indicated the formation of a mass fractal (Dm = 1.83) consistent with branching of small fundamental particles. Hexagonal MCM-41 and SBA-3 silicas, on the other hand, exhibited scattering properties consistent with moderately rough surfaces (Ds = 2.35 and 2.22, respectively) and large particle diameters ({$\gg$}1 {$\mu$}m). HMS-LTx silicas showed little or no mass fractal character (Dm = 2.87), and no surface fractal scattering.},

The local bond lengths change much more slowly with doping than the average bond length obtained crystallographically. The nn bond-length distributions are constant with doping, but higher-neighbor pair distributions broaden significantly, indicating that most of the strain from the alloying is accommodated by bond-bending forces in the alloy. PDF's of alloys across the whole doping range are well fit using a model based on the Kirkwood potential. The resulting PDF's give excellent agreement with the measured PDF's over the entire alloy range with no adjustable parameters.},

The combination of nirmatrelvir with an already used protease inhibitor class drug, ritonavir, has led to Paxlovid{\textregistered}. Several studies considered drug repositioning as the first trial for new drugs. The precise identification and quantification of polymorphs in raw materials and finished products are important to researchers involved in pharmaceutical development and quality control processes. In this work, we study the solid-state behavior of the antiretroviral drugs ritonavir and lopinavir in raw materials and in milled compositions. The results indicate that mixtures of ritonavir Forms I and II are found in different batches of raw materials from the same manufacturer; besides three equal crystalline samples, an amorphous batch was found in lopinavir. Furthermore, the milling process of the already amorphous lopinavir seems to facilitate the amorphization of ritonavir as well as the production of some unexpected crystalline forms of ritonavir. A phase transition of ritonavir Form I to Form II is only observed when co-milling with amorphous lopinavir. These findings reveal significant variations in phase purity of raw materials that affect the processing and solid-state properties, representing risks for the product quality.},

  abstract = {One can nowadays readily generate monodisperse colloidal nanocrystals, but the underlying mechanism of nucleation and growth is still a matter of intense debate. Here, we combine X-ray pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the nucleation and growth of zirconia nanocrystals from zirconium chloride and zirconium isopropoxide at 340 {$^\circ$}C, in the presence of surfactant (tri-n-octylphosphine oxide). Through E1 elimination, precursor conversion leads to the formation of small amorphous particles (less than 2 nm in diameter). Over the course of the reaction, the total particle concentration decreases while the concentration of nanocrystals stays constant after a sudden increase (nucleation). Kinetic modeling suggests that amorphous particles nucleate into nanocrystals through a second order process and they are also the source of nanocrystal growth. There is no evidence for a soluble monomer. The nonclassical nucleation is related to a precursor decomposition rate that is an order of magnitude higher than the observed crystallization rate. Using different zirconium precursors (e.g., ZrBr4 or Zr(OtBu)4), we can tune the precursor decomposition rate and thus control the nanocrystal size. We expect these findings to help researchers in the further development of colloidal syntheses.},

The crystal structures contain single MnO2 layers separated by three nonmagnetic cation-oxygen layers. The principal difference between the {$\delta\simeq$}0 and {$\delta\simeq$}0.5 compounds is the Mn valence: Mn3+ or Mn4+, and the structure of the (GaO1+{$\delta$}) buffer layer, which is formed by tetrahedra or partially filled octahedra, respectively. The magnetic moments of the manganese ions are coupled antiferromagnetically in the MnO2 plane, but antiferromagnetically (G type) or ferromagnetically (C type) between the planes for the reduced and oxidized compositions, respectively. The transition from the G- to C-type magnetic structure by oxygen doping is explained by strong diagonal 180{$^\circ$} superexchange antiferromagnetic interaction between Mn4+-ions in the adjacent layers through additional oxygen atoms in the GaO buffer layer. The magnetic moments in Sr-based samples are appreciably reduced in comparison with the spin-only values of the corresponding Mn ion. By using complementary information on local magnetic field distribution from {$\mu$}SR we show that the reduced magnetic moments seen by ND are caused by the presence of locally flipped Mn spins and a short-ranged (40{\AA}) antiferromagnetic phase. The magnetic disorder can be caused by the disorder observed in the oxygen positions of the GaO1+{$\delta$} layer, because the coupling between the MnO2 layers is mediated by the geometry of the superexchange path through these oxygen atoms.},

Owing to the stiff bonding between atoms within a molecule, the PDF peaks arising from intramolecular atom--atom distances are much sharper than those of the intermolecular atom--atom distances. This work introduces a simple approach to calculate PDFs of molecular systems without building a supercell model by using two different isotropic displacement parameters to describe atomic motion: one parameter is used for the intramolecular, the other one for intermolecular atom--atom distances. Naphthalene, quinacridone and paracetamol were used as examples. Calculations were done with the DiffPy-CMI complex modelling infrastructure. The new modelling approach produced remarkably better fits to the experimental PDFs, confirming the higher accuracy of this method for organic materials.},

  abstract = {A method towards the solution and refinement of organic crystal structures by fitting to the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) is developed. Approximate lattice parameters and molecular geometry must be given as input. The molecule is generally treated as a rigid body. The positions and orientations of the molecules inside the unit cell are optimized starting from random values. The PDF is obtained from carefully measured X-ray powder diffraction data. The method resembles `real-space' methods for structure solution from powder data, but works with PDF data instead of the diffraction pattern itself. As such it may be used in situations where the organic compounds are not long-range-ordered, are poorly crystalline, or nanocrystalline. The procedure was applied to solve and refine the crystal structures of quinacridone ({$\beta$} phase), naphthalene and allopurinol. In the case of allopurinol it was even possible to successfully solve and refine the structure in P1 with four independent molecules. As an example of a flexible molecule, the crystal structure of paracetamol was refined using restraints for bond lengths, bond angles and selected torsion angles. In all cases, the resulting structures are in excellent agreement with structures from single-crystal data.},

Our low temperature neutron powder diffraction measurements suggest the coexistence of two different Jahn-Teller (JT) distorted MnO6 octahedra when its ordered magnetic structure crosses over from type A (0.54{$\leq$}x{$\leq$}0.66) to type C/C* (0.74{$\leq$}x{$\leq$}0.90) ordering. At all doping levels at low temperature the doped holes reside predominantly in the plane of the bilayer. In the type A magnetic ordering regime, the eg electrons appear to be significantly delocalized in the plane resulting in undistorted octahedra, while in type C/C* regime, elongated JT distorted octahedra are apparent. This is consistent with the presence of inhomogeneous coexisting delocalized and localized electronic states. No evidence of macroscopic phase separation has been observed. Such nanoscale inhomogeneities may explain the magnetically frustrated behavior observed in the spin disordered `gap' region (0.66{$\leq$}x{$\leq$}0.74).},

We show that it is possible to gain insight into the chemistry and chemical clustering/ordering tendency in different regions of the sample, including in the vicinity of nano-scale crystallites that are identified from virtual dark field images and in heavily deformed regions at the edge of the BMG. In addition to simpler analysis, unsupervised machine learning was used to extract partial PDFs from the material, modeled as a quasi-binary alloy, and map them in space. These maps allowed key insights not only into the local average composition, as validated by EELS, but also a unique insight into chemical short-range ordering tendencies in different regions of the sample during formation. The experiments are straightforward and rapid and, unlike spectroscopic measurements, don't require energy filters on the instrument. We spatially map different quantities of interest (QoI's), defined as scalars that can be computed directly from positions and widths of ePDF peaks or parameters refined from fits to the patterns. We developed a flexible and rapid data reduction and analysis software framework that allows experimenters to rapidly explore images of the sample on the basis of different QoI's. The power and flexibility of this approach are explored and described in detail. Because of the fact that we are getting spatially resolved images of the nanoscale structure obtained from ePDFs we call this approach scanning nano-structure electron microscopy (SNEM), and we believe that it will be powerful and useful extension of current 4D-STEM methods.},

  abstract = {X-ray structural science is undergoing a revolution driven by the emergence of X-ray Free-electron Laser (XFEL) facilities. The structures of crystalline solids can now be studied on the picosecond time scale relevant to phonons, atomic vibrations which travel at acoustic velocities. In the work presented here, X-ray diffuse scattering is employed to characterize the time dependence of the liquid phase emerging from femtosecond laser-induced melting of polycrystalline gold thin films using an XFEL. In a previous analysis of Bragg peak profiles, we showed the supersonic disappearance of the solid phase and presented a model of pumped hot electrons carrying energy from the gold surface to scatter at internal grain boundaries. This generates melt fronts propagating relatively slowly into the crystal grains. By conversion of diffuse scattering to a partial X-ray pair distribution function, we demonstrate that it has the characteristic shape obtained by Fourier transformation of the measured F(Q). The diffuse signal fraction increases with a characteristic rise-time of 13 ps, roughly independent of the incident pump fluence and consequent final liquid fraction. This suggests the role of further melt-front nucleation processes beyond grain boundaries.},

These noble metal nanoparticles were characterized at the atomic scale using spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cs-STEM). It was found for monometallic samples that the third row, face-centered-cubic (fcc), transition metal [(3M)---Ir, Pt, and Au] particles exhibited more coherently ordered geometries than their second row, fcc, transition metal [(2M)---Rh, Pd, and Ag] analogues. The former exhibit growth habits favoring crystalline phases with specific facet structures while the latter samples are dominated by more disordered atomic arrangements that include complex systems of facets and twinning. Atomic pair distribution function (PDF) measurements further confirmed these observations, establishing that the 3M clusters exhibit longer ranged ordering than their 2M counterparts. The assembly of intracolumn bimetallic nanoparticles (Au--Ag, Pt--Pd, and Ir--Rh) using the same experimental conditions showed a strong tendency for the 3M atoms to template long-ranged, crystalline growth of 2M metal atoms extending up to over 8 nm beyond the 3M core.},

  abstract = {The lithium-conducting, rare-earth halides, Li3MX6 (M = Y, Er; X = Cl, Br), have garnered significantly rising interest recently, as they have been reported to have oxidative stability and high ionic conductivities. However, while a multitude of materials exhibit a superionic conductivity close to 1 mS cm-1, the exact design strategies to further improve the ionic transport properties have not been established yet. Here, the influence of the employed synthesis method of mechanochemical milling, compared to subsequent crystallization routines as well as classic solid-state syntheses on the structure and resulting transport behavior of Li3ErCl6 and Li3YCl6 are explored. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction, pair distribution function analysis, density functional theory, and impedance spectroscopy, insights into the average and local structural features that influence the underlying transport are provided. The existence of a cation defect within the structure in which Er/Y are disordered to a new position strongly benefits the transport properties. A synthetically tuned, increasing degree of this disordering leads to a decreasing activation energy and increasing ionic conductivity. This work sheds light on the possible synthesis strategies and helps to systematically understand and further improve the properties of this class of materials.},

Combined Rietveld and high real space resolution atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of neutron total scattering data was carried out with aims of exploring the possibility of nanoscale phase separation (PS) in relation to MI transition, and charting the evolution of local Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion of \$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{MnO\}\}\_\{6\}\$ octahedra across the OR transition at \$\{T\}\_\{S\}{\textbackslash}ensuremath\{{\textbackslash}sim\}720\$ K. The study utilized explicit two-phase PDF structural modeling, revealing that away from \$\{T\}\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{MI\}\}\$ there is no evidence for nanoscale phase coexistence. The local JT distortions disappear abruptly upon crossing into the metallic regime both with doping and temperature, with only a small temperature-independent signature of quenched disorder being observable at low temperature as compared to \$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{CaMnO\}\}\_\{3\}\$. The results hence do not support the percolative scenario for the MI transition in \$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{La\}\}\_\{1{\textbackslash}ensuremath\{-\}x\}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Ca\}\}\_\{x\}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{MnO\}\}\_\{3\}\$ based on PS, and question its ubiquity in the manganites. In contrast to \$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{LaMnO\}\}\_\{3\}\$ that exhibits long-range orbital correlations and sizable octahedral distortions at low temperature, the doped samples with compositions straddling the MI boundary exhibit correlations (in the insulating regime) limited to only \${\textbackslash}ensuremath\{{\textbackslash}sim\}1\$ nm with observably smaller distortions. In the \$x=0.22\$ sample local JT distortions are found to persist across the OR transition and deep into the \$R\$ phase (up to \${\textbackslash}ensuremath\{{\textbackslash}sim\}1050\$ K), where they are crystallographically prohibited. Their magnitude and subnanometer spatial extent remain unchanged.},

  abstract = {Alkali metals and their alloys can be protected from spontaneous reaction with dry air by intercalation (with subsequent heating) into the pores of silica gel (SG) at loadings up to 40 wt \%. The resulting loose, black powders are convenient materials for chemical reduction of organic compounds and the production of clean hydrogen. The problem addressed in this paper is the nature of the reducing species present in these amorphous materials. The atomic pair distribution function (PDF), which considers both Bragg and diffuse scattering components, was used to examine their structures. Liquid Na-K alloys added to silica gel at room temperature (stage 0) or heated to 150 {$^\circ$}C (stage I) as well as stage I Na-SG, retain the overall pattern of pure silica gel. Broad oscillations in the PDF show that added alkali metals remain in the pores as nanoscale metal clusters. 23Na MAS NMR studies confirm the presence of Na0 and demonstrate that Na+ ions are formed as well. The relative amounts of Na0 and Na+ depend on both the overall metal loading and the average pore size. The results suggest that ionization occurs near or in the SiO2 walls, with neutral metal present in the larger cavities. The fate of the electrons released by ionization is uncertain, but they may add to the silica gel lattice, or form an ``electride-like plasma'' near the silica gel walls. A remaining mystery is why the stage I material does not show a melting endotherm of the encapsulated metal and does not react with dry oxygen. Na-SG when heated to 400 {$^\circ$}C (stage II) yields a dual-phase reaction product that consists of Na4Si4 and Na2SiO3.},

Debye ({\texttheta}D) and Einstein ({\texttheta}E) temperatures were extracted from temperature-dependent PDF peak widths. A monotonic decrease in ({\texttheta}D) with nanoparticle diameter was found and could be well explained by the effect of increased surface area except in the case of the 1.78(2) nm diameter nanoparticle where the measured Debye temperature is significantly depressed from that predicted. This suggests an anomalous bond softening in the smallest sample.},

The fact that we have atomically precise structural models for these nanoparticles allows the calculation of the phonon density of states using density functional theory, providing both experimental and theoretical confirmations of the important role that the inertia of the surface capping species plays on determining the lattice dynamics.},

  abstract = {In the two step synthesis of thiolate-monolayer protected clusters (MPCs), the first step of the reaction is a mild reduction of gold(III) by thiols that generates gold(I) thiolate complexes as intermediates. Using tiopronin (Tio) as the thiol reductant, the characterization of the intermediate Au4Tio4 complex was accomplished with various analytical and structural techniques. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) were all consistent with a cyclic gold(I)-thiol tetramer structure, and final structural analysis was gathered through the use of powder diffraction and pair distribution functions (PDF). Crystallographic data has proved challenging for almost all previous gold(I)-thiolate complexes. Herein, a novel characterization technique when combined with standard analytical assessment to elucidate structure without crystallographic data proved invaluable to the study of these complexes. This in conjunction with other analytical techniques, in particular mass spectrometry, can elucidate a structure when crystallographic data is unavailable. In addition, luminescent properties provided evidence of aurophilicity within the molecule. The concept of aurophilicity has been introduced to describe a select group of gold-thiolate structures, which possess unique characteristics, mainly red photoluminescence and a distinct Au-Au intramolecular distance indicating a weak metal-metal bond as also evidenced by the structural model of the tetramer. Significant features of both the tetrameric and the aurophilic properties of the intermediate gold(I) tiopronin complex are retained after borohydride reduction to form the MPC, including gold(I) tiopronin partial rings as capping motifs, or ``staples'', and weak red photoluminescence that extends into the Near Infrared region.},

The influence of precursor substitution, ligand sterics, and reaction temperature on the final nanocrystal size was evaluated. Using saturated hydrocarbon solvents and saturated aliphatic carboxylate ligands, polymeric byproducts could be avoided and pure ZnS nanocrystals isolated. Elevated temperatures, slower precursor conversion reactivity, and branched zinc 2-hexyldecanoate yield the largest ZnS nanocrystals. Carefully purified zinc carboxylate, rapidly converting precursors, and cooling the synthesis mixture following complete precursor conversion provide quasispherical nanocrystals with the narrowest shape dispersity. Nanocrystal sizes were measured using pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of X-ray scattering and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and plotted versus the energy of their first excitonic optical absorption. The resulting empirical relationship provides a useful method to characterize the nanocrystal size from 1.7 to 4.0 nm using optical absorption spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Structural modelling of octahedral tilts in perovskites is typically carried out using the symmetry constraints of the resulting space group. In most cases, this introduces more degrees of freedom than those strictly necessary to describe only the octahedral tilts. It can therefore be a challenge to disentangle the octahedral tilts from other structural distortions such as cation displacements and octahedral distortions. This paper reports the development of constraints for modelling pure octahedral tilts and implementation of the constraints in diffpy-CMI, a powerful package to analyse pair distribution function (PDF) data. The model in the program allows features in the PDF that come from rigid tilts to be separated from non-rigid relaxations, providing an intuitive picture of the tilting. The model has many fewer refinable variables than the unconstrained space group fits and provides robust and stable refinements of the tilt components. It further demonstrates the use of the model on the canonical tilted perovskite CaTiO3 which has the known Glazer tilt system {$\alpha$}+{$\beta-\beta-$}. The Glazer model fits comparably to the corresponding space-group model Pnma below r = 14 {\AA} and becomes progressively worse than the space-group model at higher r due to non-rigid distortions in the real material.},

Here, we use ultrafast x-ray diffraction in an XFEL pump-probe experiment to examine the lattice dynamics of 300 nm polycrystalline palladium (Pd) thin films. In our experiment, at higher laser fluence levels, we directly observe a compression effect launched from the surface skin layer heated by the optical pulse which propagates across the film over the first tens of picoseconds. After that, a lattice expansion becomes dominant, followed by a quasi-steady state lasting into the nanosecond timescale. For the lowest fluence, the compression component is not detected, indicating that the dynamics is highly dependent on the laser power. Our results shed light on the dynamics behind ultrafast processes in metallic Pd, and they can be extended to different crystalline structures.},

They are found to form as nanocrystalline layers of Zr phosphate, similar to the bulk, but with a high degree of interlayer disorder and intermediate intralayer order extending around 5 nm. These materials are of interest for their high selectivity for 3+ lanthanide ions. To investigate the mechanism of the selectivity, we utilize difference pair distribution function analysis to extract the local structural environment of Tb3+ ions loaded into the framework. The ions are found to sit between the layers in a manner resembling the local environment of Tb in Scheelite-type terbium phosphate.

  abstract = {Processing procedures for inducing domain size reduction and/or amorphous phase generation can be crucial for enhancing the bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). It is important to quantify these reduced coherence phases and to detect and characterize associated structural changes, to ensure that no deleterious effects on safety, function, or stability occur. Here, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), total scattering pair distribution function (TSPDF) analysis, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SSNMR) have been performed on samples of GSK2838232B, an investigational drug for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Preparations were obtained through different mechanical treatments resulting in varying extents of domain size reduction and amorphous phase generation. Completely amorphous formulations could be prepared by milling and microfluidic injection processes. Microfluidic injection was shown to result in a different local structure due to dispersion with dichloromethane (DCM). Implications of combined TSPDF and SSNMR studies to characterize molecular compounds are also discussed, in particular, the possibility to obtain a thorough structural understanding of disordered samples from different processes.},

  abstract = {This is a review of atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis as applied to the study of molecular materials. The PDF method is a powerful approach to study short- and intermediate-range order in materials on the nanoscale. It may be obtained from total scattering measurements using X-rays, neutrons, or electrons, and it provides structural details when defects, disorder, or structural ambiguities obscure their elucidation directly in reciprocal space. While its uses in the study of inorganic crystals, glasses, and nanomaterials have been recently highlighted, significant progress has also been made in its application to molecular materials such as carbons, pharmaceuticals, polymers, liquids, coordination compounds, composites, and more. Here, an overview of applications toward a wide variety of molecular compounds (organic and inorganic) and systems with molecular components is presented. We then present pedagogical descriptions and tips for further implementation. Successful utilization of the method requires an interdisciplinary consolidation of material preparation, high quality scattering experimentation, data processing, model formulation, and attentive scrutiny of the results. It is hoped that this article will provide a useful reference to practitioners for PDF applications in a wide realm of molecular sciences, and help new practitioners to get started with this technique.},

  abstract = {The advent of fast computing allows more computationally expensive, though possibly more accurate, approaches for estimating uncertainties on Rietveld refined parameters. Here we compare three such methods, using two different refinement programs, FullProf and GSAS. This is facilitated by the use of a new Rietveld refinement package, SrRietveld, that provides Python wrappers for FullProf and GSAS. The refined values on the parameters from two different refinement engines match each other very well. The uncertainty estimates determined using the different methods are also consistent, though FullProf and GSAS estimate the parameter uncertainties slightly differently from each other, which is discussed. More importantly, we find that the refined results are very sensitive to the statistical weights used in the least squares equation. Different weights, for example from uncertain or incorrectly propagated random errors on the data, lead to significantly different refined values. This means that uncertainty estimates on refined parameters should be increased when the random errors on the data are not well known, as for example in many cases where area detectors are used, and care should be taken to propagate errors correctly in any data preprocessing such as normalization by a smoothed spectrum. The computationally expensive bootstrap error estimation methods are facilitated by the use of SrRietveld, but are not required in most cases though may be useful in some cases, for example if the random errors on the data are not well known.},

So far, static charge-density waves (CDWs) have been detected by diffraction probes only at particular doping levels or in an applied external field . However, dynamic CDWs may also be present more broadly and their detection, characterization and relationship with HTS remain open problems. Here we present a method based on ultrafast spectroscopy to detect the presence and measure the lifetimes of CDW fluctuations in cuprates. In an underdoped La1.9Sr0.1CuO4 film (Tc = 26 K), we observe collective excitations of CDW that persist up to 100 K. This dynamic CDW fluctuates with a characteristic lifetime of 2 ps at T = 5 K that decreases to 0.5 ps at T = 100 K. In contrast, in an optimally doped La1.84Sr0.16CuO4 film (Tc = 38.5 K), we detect no signatures of fluctuating CDWs at any temperature, favouring the competition scenario. This work forges a path for studying fluctuating order parameters in various superconductors and other materials.},

  abstract = {The synthesis of complex oxides at low temperatures brings forward aspects of chemistry not typically considered. This study focuses on perovskite LaMnO3, which is of interest for its correlated electronic behavior tied to the oxidation state and thus the spin configuration of manganese. Traditional equilibrium synthesis of these materials typically requires synthesis reaction temperatures in excess of 1000 {$^\circ$}C, followed by subsequent annealing steps at lower temperatures and different p(O2) conditions to manipulate the oxygen content postsynthesis (e.g., LaMnO3+x). Double-ion exchange (metathesis) reactions have recently been shown to react at much lower temperatures (500--800 {$^\circ$}C), highlighting a fundamental knowledge gap for how solids react at lower temperatures. Here, we revisit the metathesis reaction, LiMnO2 + LaOX, where X is a halide or mixture of halides, using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. These experiments reveal low reaction onset temperatures (ca. 450--480 {$^\circ$}C). The lowest reaction temperatures are achieved by a mixture of lanthanum oxyhalide precursors: 2 LiMnO2 + LaOCl + LaOBr. In all cases, the resulting products are the expected alkali halide salt and defective La1--{$\epsilon$}Mn1--{$\epsilon$}O3, where {$\epsilon$} = x/(3 + x). We observe a systematic variation in defect concentration, consistent with a rapid stoichiometric local equilibration of the precursors and the subsequent global thermodynamic equilibration with O2 (g), as revealed by computational thermodynamics. Together, these results reveal how the inclusion of additional elements (e.g., Li and a halide) leads to the local equilibrium, particularly at low reaction temperatures for solid-state chemistry.}

Material 6 obtained in this manner from molecular precursor 2 is in a poorly characterized portion of the phosphorus--sulfur phase diagram and has therefore been subjected to a range of spectroscopic techniques to gain structural insight. X-ray spectroscopic and diffraction techniques, including Raman, XANES, EXAFS, and PDF, reveal 6 to have similarities with related compounds including P4S3, Hittorf's violet phosphorus. Various possible structures have been explored as well using quantum chemical calculations under the constraint that each phosphorus atom is trivalent with no terminal sulfide groups, and each sulfur atom is divalent. The structural conclusions are supported by data from phosphorus-31 magic angle spinning (MAS) solid state NMR spectroscopy, bolstering the structural comparisons to other phosphorus--sulfur systems while excluding the formulation of P2S as a simple mixture of P4S3 and phosphorus.},

Analysis of the long-range order on the bulk material by Rietveld refinement led to approximately Na:Bi ratios of 2:1 and 4:1, in consecutive metal layers, while a detailed analysis of the local order by means of the pair distribution function revealed the existence of almost pure sodium layers and mixed 1:1 -- sodium:bismuth layers.

The surfactants are the quaternary ammonium salts C12H25NMe3Br, C14H29NMe3Br, C16H33NMe3Br, and C18H37NMe3Br, which play the role of templates, helping to assemble a three-dimensional mesostructured metal--germanium chalcogenide framework. These materials are stoichiometric in nature and have the formula of (R--NMe3)2[MGe4Q10] (Q=S, Se). The local atomic structure was probed by X-ray diffuse scattering and pair distribution function analysis methods and indicates that the adamantane clusters stay intact while the linking metal atoms possess a tetrahedral coordination environment. A model can be derived, from the comparison of measured and simulated X-ray powder diffraction patterns, describing the structure as an amorphous three-dimensional framework consisting of adamantane [Ge4Q10]4- units that are bridged by tetrahedral coordinated M2+ cations. The network structures used in the simulations were derived from corresponding disordered structures developed for amorphous silicon. The frameworks in (R--NMe3)2[MGe4Q10] are perforated with worm hole-like tunnels, occupied by the surfactant cations, which show no long-range order. This motif is supported by transmission electron microscopy images of these materials. The pore sizes of these channels were estimated to lie in the range of 20--30 {\AA}, depending on the appointed surfactant cation length. The framework wall thickness of ca. 10 {\AA} is thereby independent from the surfactant molecules used. Up to 80\% of the surfactant molecules can be removed by thermal degradation under vacuum without loss of mesostructural integrity. Physical, chemical, and spectroscopic properties of these materials are discussed.},

  abstract = {Traditional band theory of perfect crystalline solids often uses as input the structure deduced from diffraction experiments; when modeled by the minimal unit cell this often produces a spatially averaged model. The present study illustrates that this is not always a safe practice unless one examines if the intrinsic bonding mechanism is capable of benefiting from the formation of a distribution of lower symmetry local environments that differ from the macroscopically averaged structure. This can happen either due to positional or to magnetic symmetry breaking. By removing the constraint of a small crystallographic cell, the energy minimization in the density functional theory finds atomic and spin symmetry breaking, not evident in conventional diffraction experiments but being found by local probes such as atomic pair distribution function analysis. Here we report that large atomic and electronic anomalies in bulk tetragonal FeSe emerge from the existence of distributions of local positional and magnetic moment motifs. The found symmetry-broken motifs obtained by minimization of the internal energy represent what chemical bonding in the tetragonal phase prefers as intrinsic energy lowering (stabilizing) static distortions. This explains observations of band renormalization, predicts orbital order and enhanced nematicity, and provides unprecedented close agreement with spectral function measured by photoemission and local atomic environment revealed by the pair distribution function. While the symmetry-restricted strong correlation approach has been argued previously to be the exclusive theory needed for describing the main peculiarities of FeSe, we show here that the symmetry-broken mean-field approach addresses numerous aspects of the problem, provides intuitive insight into the electronic structure, and opens the door for large-scale mean-field calculations for similar -electron quantum materials.},

  abstract = {Artificial photosynthesis provides a basis for storing solar energy in chemical bonds (1, 2), with water oxidation a critical step (3, 4). The half reaction for the oxidation of water, 2H2O {$\rightarrow$} O2 + 4e- + 4H+, provides protons and electrons for the production of a fuel at a cathode (4, 5). In carrying out the reaction, it is necessary to develop highly stable molecular catalysts that cycle through multiple oxidation states during water oxidation cycles. Better mechanistic understanding of water oxidation is an important element in the correlation of structure and function in the design of high efficiency catalysts for long-term water oxidation. Since the first molecular water oxidation catalyst, the ``blue dimer,'' described (6), many examples, based largely on complexes of Ru and Ir, have appeared that demonstrate catalytic water oxidation, including mechanistic details about how the reactions occur (7, 8). Recently, catalysts based on earth-abundant elements like Fe or Co have also been prepared with the thought of scale-up at the device level in artificial photosynthetic schemes (9{$\Downarrow$}--11). A structure of interest has been the Co4O4 cluster, with a structure related to the reaction center in natural photosynthesis, the latter based on the Mn {\dots}  [↵][1]1To whom correspondence may be addressed.

  abstract = {Synthesis of metastable materials by control of reaction pathways is facilitated by low-temperature routes. Cometathesis reactions have recently been shown to lower reaction temperatures when compared to single-ion metathesis reactions. Here, we share the discovery of how and why different precursor combinations radically change the reaction pathway and selectively yield different product polymorphs. By studying reactions of the general form, xAyMnO2 + (1 -- x) A{$\prime$}zMnO2 + YOCl {$\rightarrow$} YMnO3 + xAyCl + (1 -- x)A{$\prime$}zCl (A and A{$\prime$} = Li, Na, Mg, and Ca, y and z = 1/2 or 1, and 0 {$\leq$} x {$\leq$} 1) using ex post facto synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we determine reaction onset temperatures and reaction intermediates for various combinations of A and A{$\prime$}. These observations highlight the importance of the nascent halide salt product in determining the reaction onset temperature, which is lower for all studied cometathesis reactions than the reaction temperatures of the constituent single-ion metathesis reactions. In addition, the spectating alkali and alkaline earth species determine the accessible intermediates, which steers the reaction pathways toward different product phases. While each of the studied cations has a unique reaction pathway, polymorph-selective synthesis is only achieved with a mixture of alkali or alkaline earth cations. Specifically, cation combinations of Li and Na produce phase-pure products of the hexagonal polymorph of YMnO3 and mixtures of Li and Mg or Mg and Ca produce orthorhombic YMnO3. Altogether, this study highlights how chemical potentials at reacting interfaces and the propensity to form defective structures dictates the reaction pathway such that one can target metastable materials by controlling the reaction pathways.},

Only a handful of stable ultrathin magnetic materials have been reported, but their high-yield synthesis remains a challenge. Transition metal (e.g., manganese) nitrides are attractive candidates for spintronics due to their predicted high magnetic transition temperatures. Here, a lattice matching synthesis of ultrathin Mn3N2 is employed. Taking advantage of the lattice match between a KCl salt template and Mn3N2, this method yields the first ultrathin magnetic metal nitride via a solution-based route. Mn3N2 flakes show intrinsic magnetic behavior even at 300 K, enabling potential room-temperature applications. This synthesis procedure offers an approach to the discovery of other ultrathin or 2D metal nitrides.},

However, TMN nanostructures synthesized by traditional strategies do not allow for maximum conductivity and accessibility of active sites simultaneously, which is a crucial factor for many applications in plasmonics, energy storage, sensing, and so on. Unique interconnected two-dimensional (2D) arrays of few-nanometer TMN nanocrystals not only having electronic conductivity in-plane, but also allowing transport of ions and electrolyte through the porous nanosheets, which are obtained by topochemical synthesis on the surface of a salt template, are reported. As a demonstration of their application in a lithium--sulfur battery, it is shown that 2D arrays of several nitrides can achieve a high initial capacity of {$>$}1000 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C and only about 13\% degradation over 1000 cycles at 1 C under a high areal sulfur loading ({$>$}5 mg cm-2).},

In this work, an unexpected local symmetry breaking in the tetragonal diamondoid compound AgGaTe2 is reported, which, upon warming, evolves continuously from an undistorted ground state to a locally distorted state while retaining average crystallographic symmetry. This is a rare phenomenon previously referred to as emphanisis. This distorted state, caused by the weak sd3 orbital hybridization of tetrahedral Ag atoms, causes their displacement off the tetrahedron center and promotes a global distortion of the crystal structure resulting in strong acoustic--optical phonon scattering and an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.26 W m-1 K-1 at 850 K in AgGaTe2. The findings explain the underlying reason for the unexpectedly low thermal conductivities of silver-based compounds compared to copper-based analogs and provide a guideline to suppressing heat transport in diamondoid and other materials.},

Herein we have prepared solid solutions in hierarchical solids that are built from atomically precise clusters. Two geometrically similar metal chalcogenide clusters, Co6Se8(PEt3)6 and Cr6Te8(PEt3)6, were combined as random substitutional mixture, in three different ratios, in a crystal lattice together with fullerenes. This does not alter the underlying crystalline structure of the [cluster][C60]2 material, but it influences its electronic and magnetic properties. All three solid solutions showed increased electrical conductivities compared with either the Co- or Cr-based parent material, substantially so for two of the Co:Cr ratios (up to 100-fold), and lowered activation barriers for electron transport. We attribute this to the existence of additional energy states arising from the materials' structural heterogeneity, which effectively narrow transport gaps.},

  abstract = {Whereas at low-temperatures ferroelectrics have a well understood ordered spatial dipole arrangement, the fate of these dipole configurations in the higher temperature paraelectric (PE) phase remains poorly understood. Using density functional theory (DFT), we find that, unlike the case in nonpolar {$A$}⁢{$B$}⁢O3, perovskites such as cubic BaZr⁢O3 that do not lower their energy by any form of positional symmetry breaking, the origin of distribution of the {$B$}-site off-centering in cubic PE such as BaTi⁢O3 is an intrinsic, energy lowering due to symmetry breaking. Minimizing the internal energy {$E$}0 of a constrained cubic phase represented by a large enough supercell to accommodate symmetry breaking already reveals the presence of a distribution of local displacements (i.e., a polymorphous network) that (i) locally mimics the symmetries of the low temperature phases, while (ii) being the precursors of what finite temperature density functional theory (DFT) molecular dynamics (MD) finds as thermal motifs when equilibrating the free energy . Analyzing the DFT-derived configurations of the PE cubic supercell by projecting its displacements onto irreducible representations reveals that it is best described as a temperature-dependent superposition of numerous modes, including ferroelectric and antiferroelectric ( and ), rather than a single mode, (e.g., ) representing a well-defined long-range ordered configuration. This suggests that the electronic and dielectric properties of such PE phases are best calculated from a polymorphous distribution of interrelated local motifs in large supercells rather than from either purely disordered or long-range ordered models. In this respect, PE phases share a common feature with paramagnetic (PM) and paraelastic (PEL) perovskite phases whose central feature is a polymorphous distribution of local motifs---dipole moments in PE, magnetic moments in PM, and ordinary octahedral distortion modes in PEL---all computable by DFT supercells and useable in calculating electronic and magnetic properties of paraphases.},

  abstract = {We report a combined experimental and theoretical study of CaCu3Ti4O12CaCu3Ti4O12. Based on our experimental observations of nanoscale regions of Ca-Cu antisite defects in part of the structure, we carried out density-functional theory (DFT) calculations that suggest a possible electronic mechanism to explain the gigantic dielectric response in this material. The defects are evident in atomically resolved transmission electron microscopy measurements, with supporting evidence from a quantitative analysis of the electron diffraction and DFT which suggests that such defects are reasonable on energetic grounds. To establish the extent of the defects, bulk average measurements of the local structure were carried out: extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), atomic pair-distribution function analysis of neutron powder-diffraction data, and single-crystal x-ray crystallography. The EXAFS data are consistent with the presence of the nanoclustered defects with an estimate of less than 10\% of the sample being disordered while the neutron powder-diffraction experiments place an upper of {$\sim$}5\%{$\sim$}5\% on the proportion of the sample in the defective state. Because of the difficulty of quantifying nanoscale defects at such low levels, further work will be required to establish that this mechanism is operative in CaCu3Ti4O12CaCu3Ti4O12 but it presents a nontraditional plausible avenue for understanding colossal dielectric behavior.},

  abstract = {Manganese (Mn) oxides are among the most reactive natural minerals and play an important role in elemental cycling in oceanic and terrestrial environments. A large portion of naturally-occurring Mn oxides tend to be poorly-crystalline and/or nanocrystalline, with not fully resolved crystal structures. In this study, the crystal structures of their synthetic analogs including acid birnessite (AcidBir), {$\delta$}-MnO2, polymeric MnO2 (PolyMnO2) and a bacteriogenic Mn oxide (BioMnOx), have been revealed using atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. Results unambiguously verify that these Mn oxides are layered materials. The best models that accurately allow simulation of pair distribution functions (PDFs) belong to the monoclinic C12/m1 space group with a disk-like shape. The single MnO6 layers in the average structures deviate significantly from hexagonal symmetry, in contrast to the results of previous studies based on X-ray diffraction analysis in reciprocal space. Manganese occupancies in MnO6 layers are estimated to be 0.936, 0.847, 0.930 and 0.935, for AcidBir, BioMnOx, {$\delta$}-MnO2 and PolyMnO2, respectively; however, occupancies of interlayer cations and water molecules cannot be accurately determined using the models in this study. The coherent scattering domains (CSDs) of PolyMnO2, {$\delta$}-MnO2 and BioMnOx are at the nanometer scale, comprising one to three MnO6 layers stacked with a high disorder in the crystallographic c-axis direction. Overall, the results of this study advance our understanding of the mineralogy of Mn oxide minerals in the environment.},

  abstract = {Sulfate adsorption on mineral surfaces is an important environmental chemical process. However, the structure of sulfate adsorption complexes has remained uncertain. In this study, we have determined the S--Fe distance of sulfate inner-sphere adsorption complexes on iron (Fe) oxyhydroxide (ferrihydrite) surfaces under air-dried conditions using sulfur K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and differential X-ray pair distribution function analysis. Both approaches indicate that the S--Fe interatomic distance of the sulfate adsorption complexes is 3.22--3.25 {\AA}, suggesting that sulfate forms bidentate--binuclear adsorption complexes on ferrihydrite surfaces. Outer-sphere complexes are also observed using infrared spectroscopic analysis. This finding clarifies the long-standing debate over the structure of sulfate adsorption complexes and has important implications for understanding the chemistry of sulfate at environmental interfaces.},

  abstract = {Understanding materials' atomic structure with a high level of confidence and certainty is often regarded as a very arduous and sometimes impossible task, especially for newer, emerging technology materials exhibiting limited long-range order. Nevertheless, information about atomic structural properties is very valuable for materials science and synthesis. For non-crystalline amorphous and nanoscale materials, using conventional structural determination methods is impossible. Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling is commonly used to derive models of materials from experimental diffraction data. Here, the latest developments in the fullrmc software package are discussed. Despite its name, fullrmc provides a very flexible modeling framework for solving atomic structures with many methods beyond RMC. The stochastic nature of fullrmc allows it to explore all possible dimensions and degrees of freedom for atomic modeling and create statistical solutions to match measurements. Differing versions of fullrmc are provided as open source or for cloud computing access. The latter includes a modern web-based graphical user interface that incorporates advanced computing and structure-building modules and machine-learning-based components. The main features of fullrmc are presented, including constraint types, boundary conditions, density shape functions and the two running modes: stochastic using a Monte Carlo algorithm and optimization using a genetic algorithm. Capabilities include tools for statistical, mesoscopic and nanoscopic approaches, atomic or coarse-grained models, and smart artificial-intelligence-ready loss functions.},

  abstract = {Pair distribution functions (PDFs) are a leading tool for atomic structure analysis of nanomaterials. However, the most widely used programs for refining atomic structure against PDF data are based on extended crystallographic models, which cannot be applied to discrete, whole nanoparticles. This work describes a straightforward approach to simulate and refine atomistic models of discrete clusters and nanoparticles employing widely used PDF modelling programs such as PDFgui [Farrow et al. (2007). J. Phys. Condens. Matter, 19, 335219] that utilize extended crystallographic models. In this approach, the whole particle to be modelled is contained within an expanded, and otherwise empty, unit cell that is sufficiently large to avoid correlations between atoms in neighbouring unit cells over the r range analysed. The PDF of the particle is simulated as a composite using two conventional `phases': one that calculates the atom--atom correlations and one that approximates the local number density. This approach is first validated for large nanoparticles that are well modelled by a conventional shape factor model, and then applied to simulate the PDF of discrete particles and low-dimensional materials (graphene and MXene) and to model the experimental PDF data for single-layer FeS nanosheets. A comparison of this approach with the DiffPy-CMI program [Juh{\'a}s et al. (2015). Acta Cryst. A71, 562--568], which calculates the PDF of discrete species, shows that the composite modelling approach is equally or more accurate. Example input files for implementing this approach within PDFgui and TOPAS [Coelho (2018). J. Appl. Cryst. 51, 210--218], and recommendations for selecting model parameters for reliable application of this refinement strategy, are provided.},

  abstract = {The structural properties of liquids that contain more than one atomic species are difficult to unravel. The essential reason for this is that conventional diffraction experiments measure a rather coarse average of all the {$\frac{1}{2}$}v(v+l) partial structure factors that characterize a liquid containing v species. This paper describes the way that neutron diffraction experiments carried out on samples that are identical in all respects, except that the isotope of one or more of the species has been changed, can overcome this problem. It is shown that the systematic use of isotopes, by virtue of the dependence of the neutron scattering amplitude on isotope, enables partial structure factors to be extracted directly from diffraction data. A detailed account of the method applied to a range of aqueous solutions of electrolytes under various experimental conditions is given. In particular, first-order dfference experiments yield information on ion-water conformations. Data are now available for the cations Ni2+, Ca2+ and Li+ and these results will be discussed in detail. The data for Ni2+ are of particular interest because they show that the substantial angle of tilt between the plane of the water molecule and the Ni-O axis gradually disappears as the concentration is reduced. The only anion studied so far is Cl- but the experiments have been carried out for a wide range of counter ions. We have shown that for such different electrolytes as CaCl2, NaCl and LiCl, the nature of the hydration around the Cl- ion is essentially the same. Finally, the method of second-order difference yields directly ion-ion correlations. The experiments described include Cl-Cl structure factors in NaCl and NiCl2 solutions, and the Ni-Ni structure factor in NiCl2 solutions. Comparisons made with theoretical predictions based on the primitive model of electrolytes show that in certain cases, the molecular nature of the water is a crucial factor in determining ion-ion correlations. In other cases, the primitive model contains most of the essential physics.},

The beam line is built on a bending magnet, and operates in the energy range from 5 keV to 40 keV. After the move to an undulator source in 2002, it will benefit from an extented energy range up to 60 keV and increased flux and resolution. It is anticipated that enhancements to the data quality will be achieved, leading to the solution of larger crystal structures, and improvements in the accuracy of refined structures.

The CIF is a general, flexible and easily extensible free-format archive file; it is human and machine readable and can be edited by a simple text editor. The CIF is designed for the electronic transmission of crystallographic data between individual laboratories, journals and databases: it has been adopted by the International Union of Crystallography as the recommended medium for this purpose.  The file consists of data names and data items, together with a loop facility for repeated items. The data names, constructed hierarchically so as to form data categories, are self-descriptive within a 32-character limit. The sorted list of data names, together with their precise definitions, constitutes the CIF Dictionary (Core Version 1991). The CIF Core Dictionary is presented in full and covers the fundamental and most commonly used data items relevant to crystal structure analysis. The Dictionary is also available as an electronic file suitable for CIF computer applications.  Future extensions to the Dictionary will include data items used in more specialized areas of crystallography.},

A series expansion for the inelasticity corrections has been calculated to higher order than has been done before and it is shown that the new terms are significant. It is argued, however, that there are fundamental reasons why any such correction will be inadequate for the lowest-energy neutrons. The problem of combining the results from detectors at different angles is considered and the authors present a generally applicable method for doing this in such a way that the effect of instrumental resolution is readily included. These procedures are demonstrated and tested on data obtained in an experiment to measure the structure factor of molten CsCl at 670 degrees C, close to the melting point, and at 970 degrees C using LAD. The result at the lower temperature is in good agreement with a previous result obtained using the D4 steady state diffractometer at the High Flux Reactor of the Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble. The change in the structure factor between the two temperatures can be accounted for entirely in terms of density scaling indicating that there is little, if any, change in the pair correlation function g(r) as the temperature is raised.},

In the late 1980s it was `rediscovered' as a way to uncover disorder within crystal structures and since then the combination of improved instrumentation and analysis has led to a resurgence of the total scattering method.

Concerning the question of what kind of 60-carbon atom structure might give rise to a superstable species, we suggest a truncated icosahedron, a polygon with 60 vertices and 32 faces, 12 of which are pentagonal and 20 hexagonal. This object is commonly encountered as the football shown in Fig. 1. The C60 molecule which results when a carbon atom is placed at each vertex of this structure has all valences satisfied by two single bonds and one double bond, has many resonance structures, and appears to be aromatic.},

An in-house scanning x-ray microdiffractometer is used to obtain {$\mu$}XRD patterns from 273 different compositions on a single composition spread library. NMF is then used to identify the unique {$\mu$}XRD patterns present in the system and quantify the contribution of each of these basis patterns to each experimental diffraction pattern. As a baseline, the results of NMF are compared to the results obtained using principle component analysis. The basis patterns found using NMF are then compared to reference patterns from a database of known structural patterns in order to identify known structures. As an example system, we explore a region of the Fe--Ga--Pd ternary system. The use of NMF in this case reduces the arduous task of analyzing hundreds of {$\mu$}XRD patterns to the much smaller task of identifying only nine {$\mu$}XRD patterns.},

One of the core hypotheses of M/HEAs is lattice distortion5,19,20, which has been investigated by different numerical and experimental techniques21--26. However, determining the three-dimensional (3D) lattice distortion in M/HEAs remains a challenge. Moreover, the presumed random elemental mixing in M/HEAs has been questioned by X-ray and neutron studies27, atomistic simulations28--30, energy dispersive spectroscopy31,32 and electron diffraction33,34, which suggest the existence of local chemical order in M/HEAs. However, direct experimental observation of the 3D local chemical order has been difficult because energy dispersive spectroscopy integrates the composition of atomic columns along the zone axes7,32,34 and diffuse electron reflections may originate from planar defects instead of local chemical order35. Here we determine the 3D atomic positions of M/HEA nanoparticles using atomic electron tomography36 and quantitatively characterize the local lattice distortion, strain tensor, twin boundaries, dislocation cores and chemical short-range order (CSRO). We find that the high-entropy alloys have larger local lattice distortion and more heterogeneous strain than the medium-entropy alloys and that strain is correlated to CSRO. We also observe CSRO-mediated twinning in the medium-entropy alloys, that is, twinning occurs in energetically unfavoured CSRO regions but not in energetically favoured CSRO ones, which represents,~to our knowledge, the first experimental observation of correlating local chemical order with structural defects in any material. We expect that this work will not only expand our fundamental understanding of this important class of materials but also provide the foundation for tailoring M/HEA properties through engineering lattice distortion and local chemical order.},

The Unified Theoretical and Experimental X-ray Spectroscopy application discusses a full workflow for the association, dissemination, and combined analyses of experimental data from the Advanced Light Source with MP's theoretical core data, using MPContribs tools for data formatting, management, and exploration.

There is psychological1 and physiological2,3 evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations4,5. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li--Sn--S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},

Then, standardization of the operating systems and deployment procedures helped to deliver a consistent environment to workstations and servers used by all NSLS-II beamlines. In particular, the RedHat Enterprise Linux 8 was deployed to 700+ machines using the RedHat Satellite infrastructure management product, and all critical services (IOCs, databases, etc.) were migrated to the new OS. NFS users' home directories are consistent across all of the machines, which eliminates the need for the individual configuration of the user environment on each host. The standard suite of software packages is available to the beamline staff and users, which includes the system packages (deployed via RPM) as well as the conda environments for data acquisition and analysis. Security measures were implemented to comply with the industry standards, which include multi-factor authentication (using Duo), secure screen lock for the beamline machines, and advanced access control to the experimental data that is stored in shared central storage available on all hosts. These major enhancements facilitated sharing the experimental data (currently for a number of selected beamlines, with a plan to extend it to the whole facility in the nearest future) with the users via an externally facing JupyterHub instance - https://jupyter.nsls2.bnl.gov. The beamlines keep using the Bluesky data acquisition framework to orchestrate their experiments, and the new infrastructure enabled them to use a next-generation data access library called tiled.},

The principles of x-ray diffraction and methods of determining crystal structures are summarized in the next two chapters. The final chapter describes various simple structures. Appendixes list the 230 space groups, introduce the reciprocal lattice, and describe the powder method. A well-chosen selection of problems (with solutions) encourages self-study.Ideal as the basis for a course in crystallography and highly useful as an adjunct to physical chemistry courses, this book will also serve as an excellent reference for practicing chemists, mineralogists, metallurgists, and other workers in the field. 1969 edition.},

Nevertheless, all models give a good Rietveld fit to the experimental powder pattern with acceptable               R               -values. All molecular geometries are reliable, except for model D, which is slightly distorted. All structures are crystallochemically plausible, concerning density, hydrogen bonds, intermolecular distances               etc               . All models passed the               checkCIF               test without major problems; only in model A a missed symmetry was detected. All structures could have probably been published, although 3 of the 4 structures were wrong. The investigation, which of the four structures is actually the correct one, was challenging. Six methods were used: (1) Rietveld refinements, (2) fit of the crystal structures to the pair distribution function (PDF) including the refinement of lattice parameters and atomic coordinates, (3) evaluation of the colour, (4) lattice-energy minimizations with force fields, (5) lattice-energy minimizations by two dispersion-corrected density functional theory methods, and (6) multinuclear CPMAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy (               1               H,               13               C,               19               F) including the comparison of calculated and experimental chemical shifts. All in all, model B (perhaps with some disorder) can probably be considered to be the correct one. This work shows that a structure determination from limited-quality powder data may result in totally different structural models, which all may be correct or wrong, even if they are chemically sensible and give a good Rietveld refinement. Additionally, the work is an excellent example that the refinement of an organic crystal structure can be successfully performed by a fit to the PDF, and the combination of computed and experimental solid-state NMR chemical shifts can provide further information for the selection of the most reliable structure among several possibilities.},

The method incorporates corrections for X-ray fluorescence, Bremsstrahlung radiation, polarization, attenuation, multiple scattering and sample container scattering, and invokes the Krogh-Moe and Norman method to put the data on an absolute scale. An accurate method to convert the differential scattering cross section to the pair distribution function is also described, and a rigorous and revised Lorch function is proposed for removing the effects of Fourier truncation oscillations. The method can be equally applied to synchrotron X-ray data, where the data analysis can be simpler than at a laboratory source.},

It is intended that GSAS-II will eventually replace both the GSAS and the EXPGUI packages, as well as many other utilities. GSAS-II is open source and is written largely in object-oriented Python but offers speeds comparable to compiled code because of its reliance on the Python NumPy and SciPy packages for computation. It runs on all common computer platforms and offers highly integrated graphics, both for a user interface and for interpretation of parameters. The package can be applied to all stages of crystallographic analysis for constant-wavelength X-ray and neutron data. Plans for considerable additional development are discussed.},

For this reason the algorithm became known as ``simulated annealing''. In condensed matter physics, annealing denotes a physical process in which a solid in a heat bath is heated up by increasing the temperature of the heat bath to a maximum value at which all particles of the solid randomly arrange themselves in the liquid phase, followed by cooling through slowly lowering the temperature of the heat bath. In this way, all particles arrange themselves in the low energy ground state of a corresponding lattice, provided the maximum temperature is sufficiently high and the cooling is carried out sufficiently slowly. Starting off at the maximum value of the temperature, the cooling phase of the annealing process can be described as follows.},

More recently, hybrid pixel detectors with high-Z materials have become available, opening up the benefits of this technology for high-energy diffraction experiments. However, detection layers made of high-Z materials are less perfect than those made of silicon, so care must be taken to correct the data in order to remove systematic errors in detector response introduced by inhomogeneities in the detection layer, in addition to the variation of the response of the electronics. In this paper we discuss the steps necessary to obtain the best-quality powder diffraction data from these detectors, and demonstrate that these data are significantly superior to those acquired with other high-energy detector technologies.},

  abstract = {The atomic-scale structure of amorphous solids can be determined from the X-ray, electron, or neutron scattering pattern. The atomic distribution function {$\varrho$}(r) or the pair correlation function g(r) = {$\varrho$}(r)/{$\varrho$}0, were {$\varrho$}0 is the average atomiic density, is related to the interference function or structure factor I(K) by a Fourier transformation. Unfortunately, I(K) is not directly accessible from the scattering experiment, but can be deduced from the scattering pattern after suitable corrections for polarization, absorption, inelastic scattering, multiple scattering, and static approximation, and after normalization to absolute units. In multicomponent systems, the coherent scattering function per atom Ia(K) is a weighted sum of the partial interference functions Iij(K), which represent the Fourier transforms of {$\varrho$}ij(r), the number of j-type atoms per unit volume at a distance r from an i-type atom. It is also possible to express Ia(K) as a weighted sum of number-concentration structure factors INî—¸C(K), which are associated with the number-number (density), number-concentration, and concentration-concentration correlations. The long-wavelength limit of the functions INî—¸C(CK) can be expressed in terms of the various thermodynamic quantities and their variation with composition. In binary allos, three partial functions are required to describe the atomic arrangements. These functions can be obtained by varying the atomic scattering factors fi through choic of three different radiations (X-rays, electrons, and neutrons), or isotopes in neutron scattering, or anomalous dispersion in X-ray scattering. The latest developments in the experimental techniques for the determination of the interference function I(K) are presented, and examples of the scattering patterns of metallic glasses are given, which were obtained by the conventional, variable 2{\texttheta} technique, and by the variable {$\lambda$} technique. Attempts are discussed to deduce the partial interference functions in binary systems from several scattering experiments, and to determine concentration fluctuations in binary alloys.},
